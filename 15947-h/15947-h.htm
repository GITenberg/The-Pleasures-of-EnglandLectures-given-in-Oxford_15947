<p>In the short review of the present state of English
Art, given you last year, I left necessarily many
points untouched, and others unexplained. The seventh
lecture, which I did not think it necessary to read
aloud, furnished you with some of the corrective statements
of which, whether spoken or not, it was
extremely desirable that you should estimate the balancing
weight. These I propose in the present course
farther to illustrate, and to arrive with you at, I hope,
a just&mdash;you would not wish it to be a flattering&mdash;estimate
of the conditions of our English artistic life,
past and present, in order that with due allowance for
them we may determine, with some security, what
those of us who have faculty ought to do, and those
who have sensibility, to admire.</p>

<p>2. In thus rightly doing and feeling, you will find
summed a wider duty, and granted a greater power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
than the moral philosophy at this moment current with
you has ever conceived; and a prospect opened to you
besides, of such a Future for England as you may both
hopefully and proudly labour for with your hands, and
those of you who are spared to the ordinary term of
human life, even see with your eyes, when all this
tumult of vain avarice and idle pleasure, into which you
have been plunged at birth, shall have passed into its appointed perdition.</p>

<p>3. I wish that you would read for introduction to the
lectures I have this year arranged for you, that on the
Future of England, which I gave to the cadets at
Woolwich in the first year of my Professorship here,
1869; and which is now placed as the main conclusion
of the "Crown of Wild Olive": and with it, very
attentively, the close of my inaugural lecture given
here; for the matter, no less than the tenor of which,
I was reproved by all my friends, as irrelevant and ill-judged;&mdash;which,
nevertheless, is of all the pieces of
teaching I have ever given from this chair, the most
pregnant and essential to whatever studies, whether of
Art or Science, you may pursue, in this place or elsewhere, during your lives.</p>

<p>The opening words of that passage I will take leave
to read to you again,&mdash;for they must still be the
ground of whatever help I can give you, worth your acceptance.</p>

<p>"There is a destiny now possible to us&mdash;the highest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
ever set before a nation to be accepted or refused. We
are still undegenerate in race: a race mingled of the
best northern blood. We are not yet dissolute in temper,
but still have the firmness to govern, and the grace
to obey. We have been taught a religion of pure
mercy, which we must either now finally betray, or
learn to defend by fulfilling. And we are rich in an
inheritance of honour, bequeathed to us through a
thousand years of noble history, which it should be our
daily thirst to increase with splendid avarice; so that
Englishmen, if it be a sin to covet honour, should be
the most offending souls alive. Within the last few
years we have had the laws of natural science opened
to us with a rapidity which has been blinding by its
brightness; and means of transit and communication
given to us, which have made but one kingdom of the habitable globe.</p>

<p>"One kingdom;&mdash;but who is to be its king? Is
there to be no king in it, think you, and every man to
do that which is right in his own eyes? Or only kings
of terror, and the obscene empires of Mammon and
Belial? Or will you, youths of England, make your
country again a royal throne of kings; a sceptred isle;
for all the world a source of light, a centre of peace;
mistress of Learning and of the Arts;&mdash;faithful guardian
of great memories in the midst of irreverent and
ephemeral visions&mdash;faithful servant of time-tried principles,
under temptation from fond experiments and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
licentious desires; and amidst the cruel and clamorous
jealousies of the nations, worshipped in her strange
valour, of goodwill towards men?"</p>

<p>The fifteen years that have passed since I spoke
these words must, I think, have convinced some of my
immediate hearers that the need for such an appeal
was more pressing than they then imagined;&mdash;while
they have also more and more convinced me myself
that the ground I took for it was secure, and that the
youths and girls now entering on the duties of active
life are able to accept and fulfil the hope I then held out to them.</p>

<p>In which assurance I ask them to-day to begin the
examination with me, very earnestly, of the question
laid before you in that seventh of my last year's lectures,
whether London, as it is now, be indeed the
natural, and therefore the heaven-appointed outgrowth
of the inhabitation, these 1800 years, of the valley of
the Thames by a progressively instructed and disciplined
people; or if not, in what measure and manner
the aspect and spirit of the great city may be possibly
altered by your acts and thoughts.</p>

<p>In my introduction to the Economist of Xenophon I
said that every fairly educated European boy or girl
ought to learn the history of five cities,&mdash;Athens,
Rome, Venice, Florence, and London; that of London
including, or at least compelling in parallel study,
knowledge also of the history of Paris.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>

<p>A few words are enough to explain the reasons for
this choice. The history of Athens, rightly told, includes
all that need be known of Greek religion and
arts; that of Rome, the victory of Christianity over
Paganism; those of Venice and Florence sum the
essential facts respecting the Christian arts of Painting,
Sculpture, and Music; and that of London, in her
sisterhood with Paris, the development of Christian
Chivalry and Philosophy, with their exponent art of Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>Without the presumption of forming a distinct design,
I yet hoped at the time when this division of
study was suggested, with the help of my pupils, to
give the outlines of their several histories during my
work in Oxford. Variously disappointed and arrested,
alike by difficulties of investigation and failure of
strength, I may yet hope to lay down for you, beginning
with your own metropolis, some of the lines of
thought in following out which such a task might be
most effectively accomplished.</p>

<p>You observe that I speak of architecture as the chief
exponent of the feelings both of the French and English
races. Together with it, however, most important
evidence of character is given by the illumination of
manuscripts, and by some forms of jewellery and metallurgy:
and my purpose in this course of lectures is
to illustrate by all these arts the phases of national
character which it is impossible that historians should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
estimate, or even observe, with accuracy, unless they
are cognizant of excellence in the aforesaid modes of
structural and ornamental craftsmanship.</p>

<p>In one respect, as indicated by the title chosen for
this course, I have varied the treatment of their subject
from that adopted in all my former books. Hitherto, I
have always endeavoured to illustrate the personal
temper and skill of the artist; holding the wishes or
taste of his spectators at small account, and saying of
Turner you ought to like him, and of Salvator, you
ought not, etc., etc., without in the least considering
what the genius or instinct of the spectator might otherwise
demand, or approve. But in the now attempted
sketch of Christian history, I have approached every
question from the people's side, and examined the nature,
not of the special faculties by which the work
was produced, but of the general instinct by which it
was asked for, and enjoyed. Therefore I thought the
proper heading for these papers should represent them
as descriptive of the <i>Pleasures</i> of England, rather than
of its <i>Arts</i>.</p>

<p>And of these pleasures, necessarily, the leading one
was that of Learning, in the sense of receiving instruction;&mdash;a
pleasure totally separate from that of finding
out things for yourself,&mdash;and an extremely sweet and
sacred pleasure, when you know how to seek it, and receive.</p>

<p>On which I am the more disposed, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
compelled, here to insist, because your modern ideas of
Development imply that you must all turn out what
you are to be, and find out what you are to know, for
yourselves, by the inevitable operation of your anterior
affinities and inner consciences:&mdash;whereas the old idea
of education was that the baby material of you, however
accidentally or inevitably born, was at least to be
by external force, and ancestral knowledge, bred; and
treated by its Fathers and Tutors as a plastic vase, to
be shaped or mannered as <i>they</i> chose, not as <i>it</i> chose,
and filled, when its form was well finished and baked,
with sweetness of sound doctrine, as with Hybla honey, or Arabian spikenard.</p>

<p>Without debating how far these two modes of acquiring
knowledge&mdash;finding out, and being told&mdash;may
severally be good, and in perfect instruction combined,
I have to point out to you that, broadly, Athens, Rome,
and Florence are self-taught, and internally developed;
while all the Gothic races, without any exception, but
especially those of London and Paris, are afterwards
taught by these; and had, therefore, when they chose
to accept it, the delight of being instructed, without
trouble or doubt, as fast as they could read or imitate;
and brought forward to the point where their own
northern instincts might wholesomely superimpose or
graft some national ideas upon these sound instructions.
Read over what I said on this subject in the
third of my lectures last year (page 79), and simplify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
that already brief statement further, by fastening in
your mind Carlyle's general symbol of the best attainments
of northern religious sculpture,&mdash;"three whalecubs
combined by boiling," and reflecting that the
mental history of all northern European art is the
modification of that graceful type, under the orders of
the Athena of Homer and Phidias.</p>

<p>And this being quite indisputably the broad fact of
the matter, I greatly marvel that your historians never,
so far as I have read, think of proposing to you the
question&mdash;what you might have made of yourselves
<i>without</i> the help of Homer and Phidias: what sort of
beings the Saxon and the Celt, the Frank and the
Dane, might have been by this time, untouched by the
spear of Pallas, unruled by the rod of Agricola, and
sincerely the native growth, pure of root, and ungrafted
in fruit of the clay of Isis, rock of Dovrefeldt, and
sands of Elbe? Think of it, and think chiefly what
form the ideas, and images, of your natural religion
might probably have taken, if no Roman missionary
had ever passed the Alps in charity, and no English king in pilgrimage.</p>

<p>I have been of late indebted more than I can express
to the friend who has honoured me by the dedication
of his recently published lectures on 'Older England;'
and whose eager enthusiasm and far collected learning
have enabled me for the first time to assign their just
meaning and value to the ritual and imagery of Saxon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
devotion. But while every page of Mr. Hodgett's
book, and, I may gratefully say also, every sentence of
his teaching, has increased and justified the respect in
which I have always been by my own feeling disposed
to hold the mythologies founded on the love and knowledge
of the natural world, I have also been led by
them to conceive, far more forcibly than hitherto, the
power which the story of Christianity possessed, first
heard through the wreaths of that cloudy superstition,
in the substitution, for its vaporescent allegory, of a
positive and literal account of a real Creation, and an
instantly present, omnipresent, and compassionate God.</p>

<p>Observe, there is no question whatever in examining
this influence, how far Christianity itself is true, or the
transcendental doctrines of it intelligible. Those who
brought you the story of it believed it with all their
souls to be true,&mdash;and the effect of it on the hearts of
your ancestors was that of an unquestionable, infinitely
lucid message straight from God, doing away with all
difficulties, grief, and fears for those who willingly
received it, nor by any, except wilfully and obstinately
vile persons, to be, by any possibility, denied or refused.</p>

<p>And it was precisely, observe, the vivacity and joy
with which the main fact of Christ's life was accepted
which gave the force and wrath to the controversies
instantly arising about its nature.</p>

<p>Those controversies vexed and shook, but never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
undermined, the faith they strove to purify, and the miraculous
presence, errorless precept, and loving promises
of their Lord were alike undoubted, alike rejoiced in,
by every nation that heard the word of Apostles. The
Pelagian's assertion that immortality could be won by
man's will, and the Arian's that Christ possessed no
more than man's nature, never for an instant&mdash;or in
any country&mdash;hindered the advance of the moral law
and intellectual hope of Christianity. Far the contrary;
the British heresy concerning Free Will, though
it brought bishop after bishop into England to extinguish
it, remained an extremely healthy and active
element in the British mind down to the days of John
Bunyan and the guide Great Heart, and the calmly
Christian justice and simple human virtue of Theodoric
were the very roots and first burgeons of the regeneration
of Italy.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> But of the degrees in which it was
possible for any barbarous nation to receive during the
first five centuries, either the spiritual power of Christianity
itself, or the instruction in classic art and
science which accompanied it, you cannot rightly judge,
without taking the pains, and they will not, I think, be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
irksome, of noticing carefully, and fixing permanently in
your minds, the separating characteristics of the greater
races, both in those who learned and those who taught.</p>

<p>Of the Huns and Vandals we need not speak. They
are merely forms of Punishment and Destruction. Put
them out of your minds altogether, and remember only
the names of the immortal nations, which abide on
their native rocks, and plough their unconquered plains, at this hour.</p>

<p>Briefly, in the north,&mdash;Briton, Norman, Frank, Saxon,
Ostrogoth, Lombard; briefly, in the south,&mdash;Tuscan,
Roman, Greek, Syrian, Egyptian, Arabian.</p>

<p>Now of these races, the British (I avoid the word
Celtic, because you would expect me to say Keltic; and
I don't mean to, lest you should be wanting me next to
call the patroness of music St. Kekilia), the British,
including Breton, Cornish, Welsh, Irish, Scot, and Pict,
are, I believe, of all the northern races, the one which
has deepest love of external nature;&mdash;and the richest
inherent gift of pure music and song, as such; separated
from the intellectual gift which raises song into
poetry. They are naturally also religious, and for some
centuries after their own conversion are one of the
chief evangelizing powers in Christendom. But they
are neither apprehensive nor receptive;&mdash;they cannot
understand the classic races, and learn scarcely anything
from them; perhaps better so, if the classic races
had been more careful to understand <i>them</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>

<p>Next, the Norman is scarcely more apprehensive
than the Celt, but he is more constructive, and uses to
good advantage what he learns from the Frank. His
main characteristic is an energy, which never exhausts
itself in vain anger, desire, or sorrow, but abides and
rules, like a living rock:&mdash;where he wanders, he flows
like lava, and congeals like granite.</p>

<p>Next, I take in this first sketch the Saxon and Frank
together, both pre-eminently apprehensive, both docile
exceedingly, imaginative in the highest, but in life
active more than pensive, eager in desire, swift of
invention, keenly sensitive to animal beauty, but with
difficulty rational, and rarely, for the future, wise.
Under the conclusive name of Ostrogoth, you may
class whatever tribes are native to Central Germany,
and develope themselves, as time goes on, into that
power of the German Cæsars which still asserts itself
as an empire against the licence and insolence of modern
republicanism,&mdash;of which races, though this general
name, no description can be given in rapid terms.</p>

<p>And lastly, the Lombards, who, at the time we have
to deal with, were sternly indocile, gloomily imaginative,&mdash;of
almost Norman energy, and differing from
all the other western nations chiefly in this notable
particular, that while the Celt is capable of bright wit
and happy play, and the Norman, Saxon, and Frank all
alike delight in caricature, the Lombards, like the Arabians, never jest.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>

<p>These, briefly, are the six barbaric nations who are
to be taught: and of whose native arts and faculties,
before they receive any tutorship from the south, I find
no well-sifted account in any history:&mdash;but thus much
of them, collecting your own thoughts and knowledge,
you may easily discern&mdash;they were all, with the exception
of the Scots, practical workers and builders in
wood; and those of them who had coasts, first rate
sea-boat builders, with fine mathematical instincts and
practice in that kind far developed, necessarily good
sail-weaving, and sound fur-stitching, with stout iron-work
of nail and rivet; rich copper and some silver
work in decoration&mdash;the Celts developing peculiar
gifts in linear design, but wholly incapable of drawing
animals or figures;&mdash;the Saxons and Franks having
enough capacity in that kind, but no thought of attempting
it; the Normans and Lombards still farther
remote from any such skill. More and more, it seems
to me wonderful that under your British block-temple,
grimly extant on its pastoral plain, or beside the first
crosses engraved on the rock at Whithorn&mdash;you English
and Scots do not oftener consider what you might
or could have come to, left to yourselves.</p>

<p>Next, let us form the list of your tutor nations, in
whom, it generally pleases you to look at nothing but
the corruptions. If we could get into the habit of
thinking more of our own corruptions and more of
<i>their</i> virtues, we should have a better chance of learning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
the true laws alike of art and destiny. But, the
safest way of all, is to assure ourselves that true knowledge
of any thing or any creature is only of the good
of it; that its nature and life are in that, and that what
is diseased,&mdash;that is to say, unnatural and mortal,&mdash;you
must cut away from it in contemplation, as you would in surgery.</p>

<p>Of the six tutor nations, two, the Tuscan and Arab,
have no effect on early Christian England. But the
Roman, Greek, Syrian, and Egyptian act together from
the earliest times; you are to study the influence of
Rome upon England in Agricola, Constantius, St. Benedict,
and St. Gregory; of Greece upon England in
the artists of Byzantium and Ravenna; of Syria and
Egypt upon England in St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St.
Chrysostom, and St. Athanase.</p>

<p>St. Jerome, in central Bethlehem; St. Augustine,
Carthaginian by birth, in truth a converted Tyrian,
Athanase, Egyptian, symmetric and fixed as an Egyptian
aisle; Chrysostom, golden mouth of all; these are,
indeed, every one teachers of all the western world,
but St. Augustine especially of lay, as distinguished
from monastic, Christianity to the Franks, and finally
to us. His rule, expanded into the treatise of the City
of God, is taken for guide of life and policy by Charlemagne,
and becomes certainly the fountain of Evangelical
Christianity, distinctively so called, (and broadly
the lay Christianity of Europe, since, in the purest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
form of it, that is to say, the most merciful, charitable,
variously applicable, kindly wise.) The greatest type
of it, as far as I know, St. Martin of Tours, whose
character is sketched, I think in the main rightly, in
the Bible of Amiens; and you may bind together your
thoughts of its course by remembering that Alcuin,
born at York, dies in the Abbey of St. Martin, at
Tours; that as St. Augustine was in his writings
Charlemagne's Evangelist in faith, Alcuin was, in
living presence, his master in rhetoric, logic, and astronomy,
with the other physical sciences.</p>

<p>A hundred years later than St. Augustine, comes the
rule of St. Benedict&mdash;the Monastic rule, virtually, of
European Christianity, ever since&mdash;and theologically
the Law of Works, as distinguished from the Law of
Faith. St. Augustine and all the disciples of St.
Augustine tell Christians what they should feel and
think: St. Benedict and all the disciples of St. Benedict
tell Christians what they should say and do.</p>

<p>In the briefest, but also the perfectest distinction,
the disciples of St. Augustine are those who open the
door to Christ&mdash;"If any man hear my voice"; but
the Benedictines those to whom Christ opens the door&mdash;"To
him that knocketh it shall be opened."</p>

<p>Now, note broadly the course and action of this rule,
as it combines with the older one. St. Augustine's,
accepted heartily by Clovis, and, with various degrees
of understanding, by the kings and queens of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
Merovingian dynasty, makes seemingly little difference
in their conduct, so that their profession of it remains
a scandal to Christianity to this day; and yet it lives,
in the true hearts among them, down from St. Clotilde
to her great grand-daughter Bertha, who in becoming
Queen of Kent, builds under its chalk downs her own
little chapel to St. Martin, and is the first effectively
and permanently useful missionary to the Saxons, the
beginner of English Erudition,&mdash;the first laid corner
stone of beautiful English character.</p>

<p>I think henceforward you will find the memorandum
of dates which I have here set down for my own guidance
more simply useful than those confused by record
of unimportant persons and inconsequent events, which
form the indices of common history.</p>

<p>From the year of the Saxon invasion 449, there are
exactly 400 years to the birth of Alfred, 849. You
have no difficulty in remembering those cardinal years.
Then, you have Four great men and great events to
remember, at the close of the fifth century. Clovis,
and the founding of Frank Kingdom; Theodoric and
the founding of the Gothic Kingdom; Justinian and
the founding of Civil law; St. Benedict and the founding of Religious law.</p>

<p>Of, Justinian, and his work, I am not able myself to
form any opinion&mdash;and it is, I think, unnecessary for
students of history to form any, until they are able to
estimate clearly the benefits, and mischief, of the civil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
law of Europe in its present state. But to Clovis,
Theodoric, and St. Benedict, without any question, we
owe more than any English historian has yet ascribed,&mdash;and
they are easily held in mind together, for Clovis
ascended the Frank throne in the year of St. Benedict's
birth, 481. Theodoric fought the battle of Verona,
and founded the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy twelve
years later, in 493, and thereupon married the sister of
Clovis. That marriage is always passed in a casual
sentence, as if a merely political one, and while page
after page is spent in following the alternations of furious
crime and fatal chance, in the contests between
Fredegonde and Brunehaut, no historian ever considers
whether the great Ostrogoth who wore in the battle of
Verona the dress which his mother had woven for him,
was likely to have chosen a wife without love!&mdash;or
how far the perfectness, justice, and temperate wisdom
of every ordinance of his reign was owing to the sympathy
and counsel of his Frankish queen.</p>

<p>You have to recollect, then, thus far, only three cardinal dates:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>449. Saxon invasion.</p>
<p>481. Clovis reigns and St. Benedict is born.</p>
<p>493. Theodoric conquers at Verona.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then, roughly, a hundred years later, in 590, Ethelbert,
the fifth from Hengist, and Bertha, the third from
Clotilde, are king and queen of Kent. I cannot find
the date of their marriage, but the date, 590, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
you must recollect for cardinal, is that of Gregory's
accession to the pontificate, and I believe Bertha was
then in middle life, having persevered in her religion
firmly, but inoffensively, and made herself beloved by
her husband and people. She, in England, Theodolinda
in Lombardy, and St. Gregory in Rome:&mdash;in
their hands, virtually lay the destiny of Europe.</p>

<p>Then the period from Bertha to Osburga, 590 to
849&mdash;say 250 years&mdash;is passed by the Saxon people
in the daily more reverent learning of the Christian
faith, and daily more peaceful and skilful practice of
the humane arts and duties which it invented and inculcated.</p>

<p>The statement given by Sir Edward Creasy of the
result of these 250 years of lesson is, with one correction,
the most simple and just that I can find.</p>

<p>"A few years before the close of the sixth century,
the country was little more than a wide battle-field,
where gallant but rude warriors fought with each
other, or against the neighbouring Welsh or Scots;
unheeding and unheeded by the rest of Europe, or, if
they attracted casual attention, regarded with dread
and disgust as the fiercest of barbarians and the most
untameable of pagans. In the eighth century, England
was looked up to with admiration and gratitude,
as superior to all the other countries of Western Europe
in piety and learning, and as the land whence
the most zealous and successful saints and teachers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>
came forth to convert and enlighten the still barbarous
regions of the continent."</p>

<p>This statement is broadly true; yet the correction
it needs is a very important one. England,&mdash;under
her first Alfred of Northumberland, and under Ina of
Wessex, is indeed during these centuries the most
learned, thoughtful, and progressive of European states.
But she is not a missionary power. The missionaries
are always to her, not from her:&mdash;for the very reason
that she is learning so eagerly, she does not take to
preaching. Ina founds his Saxon school at Rome not
to teach Rome, nor convert the Pope, but to drink at
the source of knowledge, and to receive laws from
direct and unquestioned authority. The missionary
power was wholly Scotch and Irish, and that power
was wholly one of zeal and faith, not of learning. I
will ask you, in the course of my next lecture, to regard
it attentively; to-day, I must rapidly draw to the conclusions
I would leave with you.</p>

<p>It is more and more wonderful to me as I think of
it, that no effect whatever was produced on the Saxon,
nor on any other healthy race of the North, either by
the luxury of Rome, or by her art, whether constructive
or imitative. The Saxon builds no aqueducts&mdash;designs
no roads, rounds no theatres in imitation of
her,&mdash;envies none of her vile pleasures,&mdash;admires, so
far as I can judge, none of her far-carried realistic art.
I suppose that it needs intelligence of a more advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>
kind to see the qualities of complete sculpture: and
that we may think of the Northern intellect as still like
that of a child, who cares to picture its own thoughts
in its own way, but does not care for the thoughts of
older people, or attempt to copy what it feels too difficult.
This much at least is certain, that for one cause
or another, everything that now at Paris or London our
painters most care for and try to realize, of ancient
Rome, was utterly innocuous and unattractive to the
Saxon: while his mind was frankly open to the direct
teaching of Greece and to the methods of bright decoration
employed in the Byzantine Empire: for these
alone seemed to his fancy suggestive of the glories
of the brighter world promised by Christianity. Jewellery,
vessels of gold and silver, beautifully written
books, and music, are the gifts of St. Gregory alike to
the Saxon and Lombard; all these beautiful things
being used, not for the pleasure of the present life,
but as the symbols of another; while the drawings in
Saxon manuscripts, in which, better than in any other
remains of their life, we can read the people's character,
are rapid endeavours to express for themselves,
and convey to others, some likeness of the realities of
sacred event in which they had been instructed. They
differ from every archaic school of former design in
this evident correspondence with an imagined reality.
All previous archaic art whatsoever is symbolic and
decorative&mdash;not realistic. The contest of Herakles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
with the Hydra on a Greek vase is a mere sign that
such a contest took place, not a picture of it, and in
drawing that sign the potter is always thinking of the
effect of the engraved lines on the curves of his pot,
and taking care to keep out of the way of the handle;&mdash;but
a Saxon monk would scratch his idea of the Fall
of the angels or the Temptation of Christ over a whole
page of his manuscript in variously explanatory scenes,
evidently full of inexpressible vision, and eager to
explain and illustrate all that he felt or believed.</p>

<p>Of the progress and arrest of these gifts, I shall
have to speak in my next address; but I must regretfully
conclude to-day with some brief warning against
the complacency which might lead you to regard them
as either at that time entirely original in the Saxon
race, or at the present day as signally characteristic of
it. That form of complacency is exhibited in its most
amiable but, therefore, most deceptive guise, in the
passage with which the late Dean of Westminster
concluded his lecture at Canterbury in April, 1854, on
the subject of the landing of Augustine. I will not
spoil the emphasis of the passage by comment as I
read, but must take leave afterwards to intimate some
grounds for abatement in the fervour of its self-gratulatory ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Let any one sit on the hill of the little church of
St. Martin, and look on the view which is there spread
before his eyes. Immediately below are the towers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
of the great abbey of St. Augustine, where Christian
learning and civilization first struck root in the Anglo-Saxon
race; and within which now, after a lapse of
many centuries, a new institution has arisen, intended to
carry far and wide, to countries of which Gregory and
Augustine never heard, the blessings which they gave
to us. Carry your view on&mdash;and there rises high above
all the magnificent pile of our cathedral, equal in splendour
and state to any, the noblest temple or church
that Augustine could have seen in ancient Rome,
rising on the very ground which derives its consecration
from him. And still more than the grandeur of
the outward buildings that rose from the little church
of Augustine and the little palace of Ethelbert have
been the institutions of all kinds of which these were
the earliest cradle. From Canterbury, the first English
Christian city,&mdash;from Kent, the first English Christian
kingdom&mdash;has by degrees arisen the whole constitution
of Church and State in England which now binds
together the whole British Empire. And from the
Christianity here established in England has flowed,
by direct consequence, first the Christianity of Germany;
then, after a long interval, of North America;
and lastly, we may trust, in time, of all India and all
Australasia. The view from St. Martin's Church is
indeed one of the most inspiriting that can be found
in the world; there is none to which I would more
willingly take any one who doubted whether a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
beginning could lead to a great and lasting good;&mdash;none
which carries us more vividly back into the past,
or more hopefully forward into the future."</p>

<p>To this Gregorian canticle in praise of the British
constitution, I grieve, but am compelled, to take these
following historical objections. The first missionary
to Germany was Ulphilas, and what she owes to these
islands she owes to Iona, not to Thanet. Our missionary
offices to America as to Africa, consist I believe
principally in the stealing of land, and the extermination
of its proprietors by intoxication. Our rule in
India has introduced there, Paisley instead of Cashmere
shawls: in Australasia our Christian aid supplies,
I suppose, the pious farmer with convict labour. And
although, when the Dean wrote the above passage, St.
Augustine's and the cathedral were&mdash;I take it on trust
from his description&mdash;the principal objects in the
prospect from St. Martin's Hill, I believe even the
cheerfullest of my audience would not now think
the scene one of the most inspiriting in the world.
For recent progress has entirely accommodated the
architecture of the scene to the convenience of the
missionary workers above enumerated; to the peculiar
necessities of the civilization they have achieved. For
the sake of which the cathedral, the monastery, the
temple, and the tomb, of Bertha, contract themselves
in distant or despised subservience under the colossal
walls of the county gaol.</p>

<h2>LECTURE II.</h2>

<h2>THE PLEASURES OF FAITH.</h2>

<h2><i>Alfred to the Confessor.</i></h2>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>


<p>I was forced in my last lecture to pass by altogether,
and to-day can only with momentary definition
notice, the part taken by Scottish missionaries in
the Christianizing of England and Burgundy. I would
pray you therefore, in order to fill the gap which I
think it better to leave distinctly, than close confusedly,
to read the histories of St. Patrick, St. Columba, and
St. Columban, as they are given you by Montalembert
in his 'Moines d'Occident.' You will find in his pages
all the essential facts that are known, encircled with
a nimbus of enthusiastic sympathy which I hope you
will like better to see them through, than distorted by
blackening fog of contemptuous rationalism. But although
I ask you thus to make yourselves aware of the
greatness of my omission, I must also certify you that
it does not break the unity of our own immediate
subject. The influence of Celtic passion and art both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
on Northumbria and the Continent, beneficent in all
respects while it lasted, expired without any permanent
share in the work or emotion of the Saxon and Frank.
The book of Kells, and the bell of St. Patrick, represent
sufficiently the peculiar character of Celtic design;
and long since, in the first lecture of the 'Two Paths,'
I explained both the modes of skill, and points of
weakness, which rendered such design unprogressive.
Perfect in its peculiar manner, and exulting in the
faultless practice of a narrow skill, it remained century
after century incapable alike of inner growth, or
foreign instruction; inimitable, yet incorrigible; marvellous,
yet despicable, to its death. Despicable, I
mean, only in the limitation of its capacity, not in its
quality or nature. If you make a Christian of a lamb
or a squirrel&mdash;what can you expect of the lamb
but jumping&mdash;what of the squirrel, but pretty spirals,
traced with his tail? He won't steal your nuts any
more, and he'll say his prayers like this&mdash;<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>; but you
cannot make a Beatrice's griffin, and emblem of all the
Catholic Church, out of him.</p>

<p>You will have observed, also, that the plan of these
lectures does not include any reference to the Roman
Period in England; of which you will find all I think
necessary to say, in the part called <i>Valle Crucis</i> of
'Our Fathers have told us.' But I must here warn
you, with reference to it, of one gravely false prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
of Montalembert. He is entirely blind to the conditions
of Roman virtue, which existed in the midst of
the corruptions of the Empire, forming the characters
of such Emperors as Pertinax, Carus, Probus, the second
Claudius, Aurelian, and our own Constantius; and
he denies, with abusive violence, the power for good,
of Roman Law, over the Gauls and Britons.</p>

<p>Respecting Roman national character, I will simply
beg you to remember, that both St. Benedict and St.
Gregory are Roman patricians, before they are either
monk or pope; respecting its influence on Britain, I
think you may rest content with Shakespeare's estimate
of it. Both Lear and Cymbeline belong to this
time, so difficult to our apprehension, when the Briton
accepted both Roman laws and Roman gods. There
is indeed the born Kentish gentleman's protest against them in Kent's&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"Now, by Apollo, king,</p>
<p>Thou swear'st thy gods in vain";</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>but both Cordelia and Imogen are just as thoroughly
Roman ladies, as Virgilia or Calphurnia.</p>

<p>Of British Christianity and the Arthurian Legends,
I shall have a word or two to say in my lecture on
"Fancy," in connection with the similar romance
which surrounds Theodoric and Charlemagne: only
the worst of it is, that while both Dietrich and Karl
are themselves more wonderful than the legends of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
them, Arthur fades into intangible vision:&mdash;this much,
however, remains to this day, of Arthurian blood in
us, that the richest fighting element in the British
army and navy is British native,&mdash;that is to say, Highlander,
Irish, Welsh, and Cornish.</p>

<p>Content, therefore, (means being now given you for
filling gaps,) with the estimates given you in the preceding
lecture of the sources of instruction possessed
by the Saxon capital, I pursue to-day our question
originally proposed, what London might have been by
this time, if the nature of the flowers, trees, and children,
born at the Thames-side, had been rightly understood and cultivated.</p>

<p>Many of my hearers can imagine far better than I,
the look that London must have had in Alfred's and
Canute's days.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> I have not, indeed, the least idea myself
what its buildings were like, but certainly the
groups of its shipping must have been superb; small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
but entirely seaworthy vessels, manned by the best
seamen in the then world. Of course, now, at Chatham
and Portsmouth we have our ironclads,&mdash;extremely
beautiful and beautifully manageable things, no
doubt&mdash;to set against this Saxon and Danish shipping;
but the Saxon war-ships lay here at London shore&mdash;bright
with banner and shield and dragon prow,&mdash;instead
of these you may be happier, but are not
handsomer, in having, now, the coal-barge, the penny
steamer, and the wherry full of shop boys and girls.
I dwell however for a moment only on the naval aspect
of the tidal waters in the days of Alfred, because I can
refer you for all detail on this part of our subject to
the wonderful opening chapter of Dean Stanley's History
of Westminster Abbey, where you will find the
origin of the name of London given as "The City of
Ships." He does not, however, tell you, that there
were built, then and there, the biggest war-ships in the
world. I have often said to friends who praised my
own books that I would rather have written that chapter
than any one of them; yet if I <i>had</i> been able to
write the historical part of it, the conclusions drawn
would have been extremely different. The Dean indeed
describes with a poet's joy the River of wells,
which rose from those "once consecrated springs which
now lie choked in Holywell and Clerkenwell, and the
rivulet of Ulebrig which crossed the Strand under the
Ivy bridge"; but it is only in the spirit of a modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
citizen of Belgravia that he exults in the fact that
"the great arteries of our crowded streets, the vast
sewers which cleanse our habitations, are fed by the
life-blood of those old and living streams; that underneath
our tread the Tyburn, and the Holborn, and the
Fleet, and the Wall Brook, are still pursuing their
ceaseless course, still ministering to the good of man,
though in a far different fashion than when Druids
drank of their sacred springs, and Saxons were baptized
in their rushing waters, ages ago."</p>

<p>Whatever sympathy you may feel with these eloquent
expressions of that entire complacency in the
present, past, and future, which peculiarly animates
Dean Stanley's writings, I must, in this case, pray you
to observe that the transmutation of holy wells into
sewers has, at least, destroyed the charm and utility
of the Thames as a salmon stream, and I must ask you
to read with attention the succeeding portions of the
chapter which record the legends of the river fisheries
in their relation to the first Abbey of Westminster;
dedicated by its builders to St. Peter, not merely in his
office of cornerstone of the Church, nor even figuratively
as a fisher of men, but directly as a fisher of
fish:&mdash;and which maintained themselves, you will see,
in actual ceremony down to 1382, when a fisherman
still annually took his place beside the Prior, after
having brought in a salmon for St. Peter, which was
carried in state down the middle of the refectory.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

<p>But as I refer to this page for the exact word, my
eye is caught by one of the sentences of Londonian<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
thought which constantly pervert the well-meant books
of pious England. "We see also," says the Dean,
"the union of innocent fiction with worldly craft, which
marks so many of the legends both of Pagan and
Christian times." I might simply reply to this insinuation
that times which have no legends differ from
the legendary ones merely by uniting guilty, instead
of innocent, fiction, with worldly craft; but I must
farther advise you that the legends of these passionate
times are in no wise, and in no sense, fiction at
all; but the true record of impressions made on the
minds of persons in a state of eager spiritual excitement,
brought into bright focus by acting steadily and
frankly under its impulses. I could tell you a great
deal more about such things than you would believe,
and therefore, a great deal more than it would do you
the least good to hear;&mdash;but this much any who care
to use their common sense modestly, cannot but admit,
that unless they choose to try the rough life of the
Christian ages, they cannot understand its practical
consequences. You have all been taught by Lord
Macaulay and his school that because you have Carpets
instead of rushes for your feet; and Feather-beds instead
of fern for your backs; and Kickshaws instead of
beef for your eating; and Drains instead of Holy Wells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
for your drinking;&mdash;that, therefore, you are the Cream
of Creation, and every one of you a seven-headed
Solomon. Stay in those pleasant circumstances and
convictions if you please; but don't accuse your
roughly bred and fed fathers of telling lies about
the aspect the earth and sky bore to <i>them</i>,&mdash;till you
have trodden the earth as they, barefoot, and seen the
heavens as they, face to face. If you care to see and
to know for yourselves, you may do it with little pains;
you need not do any great thing, you needn't keep one
eye open and the other shut for ten years over a microscope,
nor fight your way through icebergs and darkness
to knowledge of the <i>celestial</i> pole. Simply, do as
much as king after king of the Saxons did,&mdash;put rough
shoes on your feet and a rough cloak on your shoulders,
and walk to Rome and back. Sleep by the
roadside, when it is fine,&mdash;in the first outhouse you
can find, when it is wet; and live on bread and water,
with an onion or two, all the way; and if the experiences
which you will have to relate on your return do
not, as may well be, deserve the name of spiritual; at
all events you will not be disposed to let other people
regard them either as Poetry or Fiction.</p>

<p>With this warning, presently to be at greater length
insisted on, I trace for you, in Dean Stanley's words,
which cannot be bettered except in the collection of
their more earnest passages from among his interludes
of graceful but dangerous qualification,&mdash;I trace, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
only such omission, the story he has told us of the
foundation of that Abbey, which, he tells you, was the
Mother of London, and has ever been the shrine and
the throne of English faith and truth.</p>

<p>"The gradual formation of a monastic body, indicated
in the charters of Offa and Edgar, marks the
spread of the Benedictine order throughout England,
under the influence of Dunstan. The 'terror' of the
spot, which had still been its chief characteristic in
the charter of the wild Offa, had, in the days of the
more peaceful Edgar, given way to a dubious 'renown.'
Twelve monks is the number traditionally said to have
been established by Dunstan. A few acres further up
the river formed their chief property, and their monastic
character was sufficiently recognized to have given
to the old locality of the 'terrible place' the name of
the 'Western Monastery,' or 'Minster of the West.'"</p>

<p>The Benedictines then&mdash;twelve Benedictine monks&mdash;thus
begin the building of existent Christian London.
You know I told you the Benedictines are the
Doing people, as the disciples of St. Augustine the
Sentimental people. The Benedictines find no terror
in their own thoughts&mdash;face the terror of places&mdash;change
it into beauty of places,&mdash;make this terrible
place, a Motherly Place&mdash;Mother of London.</p>

<p>This first Westminster, however, the Dean goes on
to say, "seems to have been overrun by the Danes,"
and it would have had no further history but for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
combination of circumstances which directed hither the
notice of Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>I haven't time to read you all the combination of circumstances.
The last clinching circumstance was this&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was in the neighbourhood of Worcester, 'far
from men in the wilderness, on the slope of a wood, in
a cave deep down in the grey rock,' a holy hermit 'of
great age, living on fruits and roots.' One night when,
after reading in the Scriptures 'how hard are the pains
of hell, and how the enduring life of Heaven is sweet
and to be desired,' he could neither sleep nor repose,
St. Peter appeared to him, 'bright and beautiful, like
to a clerk,' and warned him to tell the King that he
was released from his vow; that on that very day his
messengers would return from Rome;" (that is the
combination of circumstances&mdash;bringing Pope's order
to build a church to release the King from his vow of
pilgrimage); "that 'at Thorney, two leagues from the
city,' was the spot marked out where, in an ancient
church, 'situated low,' he was to establish a perfect
Benedictine monastery, which should be 'the gate of
heaven, the ladder of prayer, whence those who serve
St. Peter there, shall by him be admitted into Paradise.'
The hermit writes the account of the vision on
parchment, seals it with wax, and brings it to the King,
who compares it with the answer of the messengers,
just arrived from Rome, and determines on carrying
out the design as the Apostle had ordered.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>

<p>"The ancient church, 'situated low,' indicated in this
vision the one whose attached monastery had been
destroyed by the Danes, but its little church remained,
and was already dear to the Confessor, not only from
the lovely tradition of its dedication by the spirit of
St. Peter;" (you must read that for yourselves;) "but
also because of two miracles happening there to the King himself.</p>

<p>"The first was the cure of a cripple, who sat in the
road between the Palace and 'the Chapel of St. Peter,'
which was 'near,' and who explained to the Chamberlain
Hugolin that, after six pilgrimages to Rome in
vain, St. Peter had promised his cure if the King
would, on his own royal neck, carry him to the Monastery.
The King immediately consented; and, amidst
the scoffs of the court, bore the poor man to the steps
of the High Altar. There the cripple was received by
Godric the sacristan, and walked away on his own
restored feet, hanging his stool on the wall for a trophy.</p>

<p>"Before that same High Altar was also believed to
have been seen one of the Eucharistical portents, so
frequent in the Middle Ages. A child, 'pure and
bright like a spirit,' appeared to the King in the sacramental
elements. Leofric, Earl of Mercia, who, with
his famous countess, Godiva, was present, saw it also.</p>

<p>"Such as these were the motives of Edward. Under
their influence was fixed what has ever since been
the local centre of the English monarchy."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>

<p>"Such as these were the <i>motives</i> of Edward," says
the Dean. Yes, certainly; but such as these also, first,
were the acts and visions of Edward. Take care that
you don't slip away, by the help of the glycerine of
the word "motives," into fancying that all these tales
are only the after colours and pictorial metaphors of
sentimental piety. They are either plain truth or black
lies; take your choice,&mdash;but don't tickle and treat
yourselves with the prettiness or the grotesqueness of
them, as if they were Anderssen's fairy tales. Either
the King did carry the beggar on his back, or he
didn't; either Godiva rode through Coventry, or she
didn't; either the Earl Leofric saw the vision of the
bright child at the altar&mdash;or he lied like a knave.
Judge, as you will; but do not Doubt.</p>

<p>"The Abbey was fifteen years in building. The
King spent upon it one-tenth of the property of the
kingdom. It was to be a marvel of its kind. As in
its origin it bore the traces of the fantastic and childish"
(I must pause, to ask you to substitute for these
blameful terms, 'fantastic and childish,' the better ones
of 'imaginative and pure') "character of the King
and of the age; in its architecture it bore the stamp
of the peculiar position which Edward occupied in
English history between Saxon and Norman. By birth
he was a Saxon, but in all else he was a foreigner.
Accordingly the Church at Westminster was a wide-sweeping
innovation on all that had been seen before.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
'Destroying the old building,' he says in his charter,
'I have built up a new one from the very foundation.'
Its fame as a 'new style of composition' lingered in
the minds of men for generations. It was the first
cruciform church in England, from which all the rest of
like shape were copied&mdash;an expression of the increasing
hold which, in the tenth century, the idea of the
Crucifixion had laid on the imagination of Europe.
The massive roof and pillars formed a contrast with
the rude wooden rafters and beams of the common
Saxon churches. Its very size&mdash;occupying, as it did,
almost the whole area of the present building&mdash;was
in itself portentous. The deep foundations, of large
square blocks of grey stone, were duly laid; the east
end was rounded into an apse; a tower rose in the
centre, crowned by a cupola of wood. At the western
end were erected two smaller towers, with five large
bells. The hard strong stones were richly sculptured;
the windows were filled with stained glass; the roof
was covered with lead. The cloisters, chapter-house,
refectory, dormitory, the infirmary, with its spacious
chapel, if not completed by Edward, were all begun,
and finished in the next generation on the same plan.
This structure, venerable as it would be if it had lasted
to our time, has almost entirely vanished. Possibly
one vast dark arch in the southern transept, certainly
the substructures of the dormitory, with their huge
pillars, 'grand and regal at the bases and capitals,' the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
massive, low-browed passage leading from the great
cloister to Little Dean's Yard, and some portions of
the refectory and of the infirmary chapel, remain as
specimens of the work which astonished the last age
of the Anglo-Saxon and the first age of the Norman monarchy."</p>

<p>Hitherto I have read to you with only supplemental
comment. But in the next following passage, with
which I close my series of extracts, sentence after sentence
occurs, at which as I read, I must raise my hand,
to mark it for following deprecation, or denial.</p>

<p>"In the centre of Westminster Abbey thus lies its
Founder, and such is the story of its foundation. Even
apart from the legendary elements in which it is involved,
it is impossible not to be struck by the fantastic
character of all its circumstances. We seem to be in
a world of poetry." (I protest, No.) "Edward is four
centuries later than Ethelbert and Augustine; but the
origin of Canterbury is commonplace and prosaic compared
with the origin of Westminster." (Yes, that's
true.) "We can hardly imagine a figure more incongruous
to the soberness of later times than the quaint,
irresolute, wayward prince whose chief characteristics
have just been described. His titles of Confessor and
Saint belong not to the general instincts of Christendom
but to the most transitory feelings of the age."
(I protest, No.) "His opinions, his prevailing motives,
were such as in no part of modern Europe would now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
be shared by any educated teacher or ruler." (That's
true enough.) "But in spite of these irreconcilable
differences, there was a solid ground for the charm
which he exercised over his contemporaries. His
childish and eccentric fancies have passed away;" (I
protest, No;) "but his innocent faith and his sympathy
with his people are qualities which, even in our altered
times, may still retain their place in the economy of
the world. Westminster Abbey, so we hear it said,
sometimes with a cynical sneer, sometimes with a timorous
scruple, has admitted within its walls many who
have been great without being good, noble with a
nobleness of the earth earthy, worldly with the wisdom
of this world. But it is a counterbalancing reflection,
that the central tomb, round which all those famous
names have clustered, contains the ashes of one who,
weak and erring as he was, rests his claims of interment
here, not on any act of power or fame, but only
on his artless piety and simple goodness. He, towards
whose dust was attracted the fierce Norman, and the
proud Plantagenet, and the grasping Tudor, and the
fickle Stuart, even the Independent Oliver, the Dutch
William, and the Hanoverian George, was one whose
humble graces are within the reach of every man,
woman, and child of every time, if we rightly part the
immortal substance from the perishable form."</p>

<p>Now I have read you these passages from Dean
Stanley as the most accurately investigatory, the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>
generously sympathetic, the most reverently acceptant
account of these days, and their people, which you can
yet find in any English history. But consider now,
point by point, where it leaves you. You are told,
first, that you are living in an age of poetry. But the
days of poetry are those of Shakespeare and Milton,
not of Bede: nay, for their especial wealth in melodious
theology and beautifully rhythmic and pathetic
meditation, perhaps the days which have given us
'Hiawatha,' 'In Memoriam,' 'The Christian Year,' and
the 'Soul's Diary' of George Macdonald, may be not
with disgrace compared with those of Caedmon. And
nothing can be farther different from the temper, nothing
less conscious of the effort, of a poet, than any
finally authentic document to which you can be referred
for the relation of a Saxon miracle.</p>

<p>I will read you, for a perfectly typical example, an
account of one from Bede's 'Life of St. Cuthbert,'
The passage is a favourite one of my own, but I do not
in the least anticipate its producing upon you the solemnizing
effect which I think I could command from
reading, instead, a piece of 'Marmion,' 'Manfred,' or 'Childe Harold.'</p>

<p>... "He had one day left his cell to give advice
to some visitors; and when he had finished, he said to
them, 'I must now go in again, but do you, as you are
inclined to depart, first take food; and when you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
cooked and eaten that goose which is hanging on the
wall, go on board your vessel in God's name and return
home.' He then uttered a prayer, and, having blessed
them, went in. But they, as he had bidden them, took
some food; but having enough provisions of their
own, which they had brought with them, they did not touch the goose.</p>

<p>"But when they had refreshed themselves they tried
to go on board their vessel, but a sudden storm utterly
prevented them from putting to sea. They were thus
detained seven days in the island by the roughness of
the waves, and yet they could not call to mind what
fault they had committed. They therefore returned to
have an interview with the holy father, and to lament
to him their detention. He exhorted them to be patient,
and on the seventh day came out to console their
sorrow, and to give them pious exhortations. When,
however, he had entered the house in which they were
stopping, and saw that the goose was not eaten, he
reproved their disobedience with mild countenance and
in gentle language: 'Have you not left the goose still
hanging in its place? What wonder is it that the
storm has prevented your departure? Put it immediately
into the caldron, and boil and eat it, that the sea
may become tranquil, and you may return home.'</p>

<p>"They immediately did as he commanded; and it
happened most wonderfully that the moment the kettle
began to boil the wind began to cease, and the waves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
to be still Having finished their repast, and seeing
that the sea was calm, they went on board, and to their
great delight, though with shame for their neglect,
reached home with a fair wind. Now this, as I have
related, I did not pick up from any chance authority,
but I had it from one of those who were present, a
most reverend monk and priest of the same monastery,
Cynemund, who still lives, known to many in the
neighbourhood for his years and the purity of his life."</p>

<hr />

<p>I hope that the memory of this story, which, thinking
it myself an extremely pretty one, I have given
you, not only for a type of sincerity and simplicity, but
for an illustration of obedience, may at all events quit
you, for good and all, of the notion that the believers
and witnesses of miracle were poetical persons. Saying
no more on the head of that allegation, I proceed
to the Dean's second one, which I cannot but interpret
as also intended to be injurious,&mdash;that they were artless
and childish ones; and that because of this rudeness
and puerility, their motives and opinions would
not be shared by any statesmen of the present day.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that Edward the Confessor was
himself in many respects of really childish temperament;
not therefore, perhaps, as I before suggested to
you, less venerable. But the age of which we are examining
the progress, was by no means represented or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
governed by men of similar disposition. It was eminently
productive of&mdash;it was altogether governed,
guided, and instructed by&mdash;men of the widest and
most brilliant faculties, whether constructive or speculative,
that the world till then had seen; men whose
acts became the romance, whose thoughts the wisdom,
and whose arts the treasure, of a thousand years of futurity.</p>

<p>I warned you at the close of last lecture against
the too agreeable vanity of supposing that the Evangelization
of the world began at St. Martin's, Canterbury.
Again and again you will indeed find the stream
of the Gospel contracting itself into narrow channels,
and appearing, after long-concealed filtration, through
veins of unmeasured rock, with the bright resilience
of a mountain spring. But you will find it the only
candid, and therefore the only wise, way of research,
to look in each era of Christendom for the minds of
culminating power in all its brotherhood of nations;
and, careless of local impulse, momentary zeal, picturesque
incident, or vaunted miracle, to fasten your attention
upon the force of character in the men, whom,
over each newly-converted race, Heaven visibly sets for
its shepherds and kings, to bring forth judgment unto
victory. Of these I will name to you, as messengers
of God and masters of men, five monks and five kings;
in whose arms during the range of swiftly gainful
centuries which we are following, the life of the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
lay as a nursling babe. Remember, in their successive
order,&mdash;of monks, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, St. Martin,
St. Benedict, and St. Gregory; of kings,&mdash;and
your national vanity may be surely enough appeased in
recognizing two of them for Saxon,&mdash;Theodoric, Charlemagne,
Alfred, Canute, and the Confessor. I will
read three passages to you, out of the literal words of
three of these ten men, without saying whose they are,
that you may compare them with the best and most
exalted you have read expressing the philosophy, the
religion, and the policy of to-day,&mdash;from which I admit,
with Dean Stanley, but with a far different meaning
from his, that they are indeed separate for evermore.
I give you first, for an example of Philosophy, a
single sentence, containing all&mdash;so far as I can myself
discern&mdash;that it is possible for us to know, or well for
us to believe, respecting the world and its laws.</p>


<p>"OF GOD'S UNIVERSAL PROVIDENCE, RULING ALL, AND COMPRISING ALL.</p>

<p>"Wherefore the great and mighty God; He that made
man a reasonable creature of soul and body, and He that did
neither let him pass unpunished for his sin, nor yet excluded
him from mercy; He that gave, both unto good and bad,
essence with the stones, power of production with the trees,
senses with the beasts of the field, and understanding with the
angels; He from whom is all being, beauty, form, and
number, weight, and measure; He from whom all nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
mean and excellent, all seeds of form, all forms of seed, all
motion, both of forms and seeds, derive and have being; He
that gave flesh the original beauty, strength, propagation, form
and shape, health and symmetry; He that gave the unreasonable
soul, sense, memory, and appetite; the reasonable, besides
these, fantasy, understanding, and will; He, I say,
having left neither heaven, nor earth, nor angel, nor man, no,
nor the most base and contemptible creature, neither the bird's
feather, nor the herb's flower, nor the tree's leaf, without the
true harmony of their parts, and peaceful concord of composition:&mdash;It
is in no way credible that He would leave the
kingdoms of men and their bondages and freedom loose and
uncomprised in the laws of His eternal providence."<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>This for the philosophy.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> Next, I take for example
of the Religion of our ancestors, a prayer, personally
and passionately offered to the Deity conceived as you have this moment heard.</p>

<p>"O Thou who art the Father of that Son which has awakened
us, and yet urgeth us out of the sleep of our sins, and
exhorteth us that we become Thine;" (note you that, for apprehension
of what Redemption means, against your base and
cowardly modern notion of 'scaping whipping. Not to take
away the Punishment of Sin, but by His Resurrection to raise
us out of the sleep of sin itself! Compare the legend at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
feet of the Lion of the Tribe of Judah in the golden Gospel
of Charles le Chauve<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"HIC LEO SURGENDO PORTAS CONFREGIT AVERNI</p>
<p>QUI NUNQUAM DORMIT, NUSQUAM DORMITAT IN ÆVUM;")</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>"to Thee, Lord, I pray, who art the supreme truth; for all the
truth that is, is truth from Thee. Thee I implore, O Lord,
who art the highest wisdom. Through Thee are wise all those
that are so. Thou art the true life, and through Thee are
living all those that are so. Thou art the supreme felicity,
and from Thee all have become happy that are so. Thou art
the highest good, and from Thee all beauty springs. Thou
art the intellectual light, and from Thee man derives his understanding.</p>

<p>"To Thee, O God, I call and speak. Hear, O hear me,
Lord! for Thou art my God and my Lord; my Father and
my Creator; my ruler and my hope; my wealth and my honour
my house, my country, my salvation, and my life! Hear,
hear me, O Lord! Few of Thy servants comprehend Thee.
But Thee alone I <i>love</i>,<a id="footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href="#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> indeed, above all other things. Thee
I seek: Thee I will follow: Thee I am ready to serve. Under
Thy power I desire to abide, for Thou alone art the Sovereign
of all. I pray Thee to command me as Thou wilt."</p>

<p>You see this prayer is simply the expansion of that
clause of the Lord's Prayer which most men eagerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>
omit from it,&mdash;<i>Fiat voluntas tua</i>. In being so, it sums
the Christian prayer of all ages. See now, in the third
place, how far this king's letter I am going to read to
you sums also Christian Policy.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Wherefore I render high thanks to Almighty God, for the
happy accomplishment of all the desires which I have set
before me, and for the satisfying of my every wish.</p>

<p>"Now therefore, be it known to you all, that to Almighty
God Himself I have, on my knees, devoted my life, to the
end that in all things I may do justice, and with justice and
rightness rule the kingdoms and peoples under me; throughout
everything preserving an impartial judgment. If, heretofore,
I have, through being, as young men are, impulsive or
careless, done anything unjust, I mean, with God's help, to
lose no time in remedying my fault. To which end I call
to witness my counsellors, to whom I have entrusted the counsels
of the kingdom, and I charge them that by no means,
be it through fear of me, or the favour of any other powerful
personage, to consent to any injustice, or to suffer any to shoot
out in any part of my kingdom. I charge all my viscounts
and those set over my whole kingdom, as they wish to keep
my friendship or their own safety, to use no unjust force to
any man, rich or poor; let all men, noble and not noble, rich
and poor alike, be able to obtain their rights under the law's
justice; and from that law let there be no deviation, either
to favour the king or any powerful person, nor to raise money
for me. I have no need of money raised by what is unfair.
I also would have you know that I go now to make peace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
and firm treaty by the counsels of all my subjects, with those
nations and people who wished, had it been possible for them
to do so, which it was not, to deprive us alike of kingdom
and of life. God brought down their strength to nought: and
may He of His benign love preserve us on our throne and in
honour. Lastly, when I have made peace with the neighbouring
nations, and settled and pacified all my dominions in the
East, so that we may nowhere have any war or enmity to fear,
I mean to come to England this summer, as soon as I can fit
out vessels to sail. My reason, however, in sending this letter
first is to let all the people of my kingdom share in the joy
of my welfare: for as you yourselves know, I have never spared
myself or my labour; nor will I ever do so, where my people
are really in want of some good that I can do them."
</p></blockquote>

<p>What think you now, in candour and honour, you
youth of the latter days,&mdash;what think you of these
types of the thought, devotion, and government, which
not in words, but pregnant and perpetual fact, animated
these which you have been accustomed to call the Dark Ages?</p>

<p>The Philosophy is Augustine's; the Prayer Alfred's; and the Letter Canute's.</p>

<p>And, whatever you may feel respecting the beauty
or wisdom of these sayings, be assured of one thing
above all, that they are sincere; and of another, less
often observed, that they are joyful.</p>

<p>Be assured, in the first place, that they are sincere,
The ideas of diplomacy and priestcraft are of recent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
times. No false knight or lying priest ever prospered,
I believe, in any age, but certainly not in the dark
ones. Men prospered then, only in following openly-declared
purposes, and preaching candidly beloved and trusted creeds.</p>

<p>And that they did so prosper, in the degree in which
they accepted and proclaimed the Christian Gospel,
may be seen by any of you in your historical reading,
however partial, if only you will admit the idea that it
could be so, and was likely to be so. You are all of
you in the habit of supposing that temporal prosperity
is owing either to worldly chance or to worldly prudence;
and is never granted in any visible relation to
states of religious temper. Put that treacherous doubt
away from you, with disdain; take for basis of reasoning
the noble postulate, that the elements of Christian
faith are sound,&mdash;instead of the base one, that they
are deceptive; reread the great story of the world in
that light, and see what a vividly real, yet miraculous
tenor, it will then bear to you.</p>

<p>Their faith then, I tell you first, was sincere; I tell
you secondly that it was, in a degree few of us can now
conceive, joyful. We continually hear of the trials,
sometimes of the victories, of Faith,&mdash;but scarcely
ever of its pleasures. Whereas, at this time, you will
find that the chief delight of all good men was in the
recognition of the goodness and wisdom of the Master,
who had come to dwell with them upon earth. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
almost impossible for you to conceive the vividness of
this sense in them; it is totally impossible for you to
conceive the comfort, peace, and force of it. In everything
that you now do or seek, you expose yourselves
to countless miseries of shame and disappointment,
because in your doing you depend on nothing but your
own powers, and in seeking choose only your own
gratification. You cannot for the most part conceive
of any work but for your own interests, or the interests
of others about whom you are anxious in the same
faithless way; everything about which passion is excited
in you or skill exerted is some object of material
life, and the idea of doing anything except for your
own praise or profit has narrowed itself into little more
than the precentor's invitation to the company with
little voice and less practice to "sing to the praise and glory of God."</p>

<p>I have said that you cannot imagine the feeling of
the energy of daily life applied in the real meaning of
those words. You cannot imagine it, but you <i>can</i>
prove it. Are any of you willing, simply as a philosophical
experiment in the greatest of sciences, to
adopt the principles and feelings of these men of a
thousand years ago for a given time, say for a year?
It cannot possibly do you any harm to try, and you
cannot possibly learn what is true in these things,
without trying. If after a year's experience of such
method you find yourself no happier than before, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>
least you will be able to support your present opinions
at once with more grace and more modesty; having
conceded the trial it asked for, to the opposite side.
Nor in acting temporarily on a faith you do not see to
be reasonable, do you compromise your own integrity
more, than in conducting, under a chemist's directions,
an experiment of which he foretells inexplicable consequences.
And you need not doubt the power you
possess over your own minds to do this. Were faith
not voluntary, it could not be praised, and would not be rewarded.</p>

<p>If you are minded thus to try, begin each day with
Alfred's prayer,&mdash;fiat voluntas tua; resolving that you
will stand to it, and that nothing that happens in the
course of the day shall displease you. Then set to any
work you have in hand with the sifted and purified
resolution that ambition shall not mix with it, nor love
of gain, nor desire of pleasure more than is appointed
for you; and that no anxiety shall touch you as to its
issue, nor any impatience nor regret if it fail. Imagine
that the thing is being done through you, not by you;
that the good of it may never be known, but that at
least, unless by your rebellion or foolishness, there can
come no evil into it, nor wrong chance to it. Resolve
also with steady industry to do what you can for the
help of your country and its honour, and the honour of
its God; and that you will not join hands in its iniquity,
nor turn aside from its misery; and that in all you do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
and feel you will look frankly for the immediate help
and direction, and to your own consciences, expressed
approval, of God. Live thus, and believe, and with
swiftness of answer proportioned to the frankness of
the trust, most surely the God of hope will fill you with
all joy and peace in believing.</p>

<p>But, if you will not do this, if you have not courage
nor heart enough to break away the fetters of earth,
and take up the sensual bed of it, and walk; if you say
that you are <i>bound</i> to win this thing, and become the
other thing, and that the wishes of your friends,&mdash;and
the interests of your family,&mdash;and the bias of your
genius,&mdash;and the expectations of your college,&mdash;and
all the rest of the bow-wow-wow of the wild dog-world,
must be attended to, whether you like it or no,&mdash;then,
at least, for shame give up talk about being free or
independent creatures; recognize yourselves for slaves
in whom the thoughts are put in ward with their
bodies, and their hearts manacled with their hands:
and then at least also, for shame, if you refuse to believe
that ever there were men who gave their souls to
God,&mdash;know and confess how surely there are those
who sell them to His adversary.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III.</h2>

<h2>THE PLEASURES OF DEED.</h2>

<h2><i>Alfred to Cœur de Lion.</i></h2>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>


<p>It was my endeavour, in the preceding lecture, to
vindicate the thoughts and arts of our Saxon ancestors
from whatever scorn might lie couched under
the terms applied to them by Dean Stanley,&mdash;'fantastic'
and 'childish.' To-day my task must be carried
forward, first, in asserting the grace in fantasy, and
the force in infancy, of the English mind, before the
Conquest, against the allegations contained in the
final passage of Dean Stanley's description of the first
founded Westminster; a passage which accepts and
asserts, more distinctly than any other equally brief
statement I have met with, the to my mind extremely
disputable theory, that the Norman invasion was in
every respect a sanitary, moral, and intellectual blessing
to England, and that the arrow which slew her
Harold was indeed the Arrow of the Lord's deliverance.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>

<p>"The Abbey itself," says Dean Stanley,&mdash;"the
chief work of the Confessor's life,&mdash;was the portent
of the mighty future. When Harold stood beside his
sister Edith, on the day of the dedication, and signed
his name with hers as witness to the Charter of the
Abbey, he might have seen that he was sealing his
own doom, and preparing for his own destruction. The
solid pillars, the ponderous arches, the huge edifice,
with triple tower and sculptured stones and storied windows,
that arose in the place and in the midst of the
humble wooden churches and wattled tenements of the
Saxon period, might have warned the nobles who were
present that the days of their rule were numbered,
and that the <i>avenging, civilizing, stimulating</i> hand of
another and a mightier race was at work, which would
change the whole face of their language, their manners,
their Church, and their commonwealth. The Abbey,
so far exceeding the demands of the <i>dull and stagnant</i>
minds of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors, was founded not
only in faith, but in hope: in the hope that England
had yet a glorious career to run; that the line of her
sovereigns would not be broken, even when the race of
Alfred had ceased to reign."</p>

<p>There must surely be some among my hearers who
are startled, if not offended, at being told in the terms
which I emphasized in this sentence, that the minds
of our Saxon fathers were, although fantastic, dull,
and, although childish, stagnant; that farther, in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>
fantastic stagnation; they were savage,&mdash;and in their
innocent dullness, criminal; so that the future character
and fortune of the race depended on the critical
advent of the didactic and disciplinarian Norman baron,
at once to polish them, stimulate, and chastise.</p>

<p>Before I venture to say a word in distinct arrest of
this judgment, I will give you a chart, as clear as the
facts observed in the two previous lectures allow, of
the state and prospects of the Saxons, when this violent
benediction of conquest happened to them: and
especially I would rescue, in the measure that justice
bids, the memory even of their Pagan religion from
the general scorn in which I used Carlyle's description
of the idol of ancient Prussia as universally exponent of
the temper of Northern devotion. That Triglaph, or
Triglyph Idol, (derivation of Triglaph wholly unknown
to me&mdash;I use Triglyph only for my own handiest epithet),
last set up, on what is now St. Mary's hill in
Brandenburg, in 1023, belonged indeed to a people
wonderfully like the Saxons,&mdash;geographically their
close neighbours,&mdash;in habits of life, and aspect of
native land, scarcely distinguishable from them,&mdash;in
Carlyle's words, a "strong-boned, iracund, herdsman
and fisher people, highly averse to be interfered with,
in their religion especially, and inhabiting a moory flat
country, full of lakes and woods, but with plenty also
of alluvial mud, grassy, frugiferous, apt for the plough"&mdash;in
all things like the Saxons, except, as I read the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
matter, in that 'aversion to be interfered with' which
you modern English think an especially Saxon character
in you,&mdash;but which is, on the contrary, you will
find on examination, by no means Saxon; but only
Wendisch, Czech, Serbic, Sclavic,&mdash;other hard names
I could easily find for it among the tribes of that vehemently
heathen old Preussen&mdash;"resolutely worshipful
of places of oak trees, of wooden or stone idols, of
Bangputtis, Patkullos, and I know not what diabolic
dumb blocks." Your English "dislike to be interfered
with" is in absolute fellowship with these, but only
gathers itself in its places of Stalks, or chimneys, instead
of oak trees, round its idols of iron, instead of
wood, diabolically <i>vocal</i> now; strident, and sibilant, instead of dumb.</p>

<p>Far other than these, their neighbour Saxons, Jutes
and Angles!&mdash;tribes between whom the distinctions
are of no moment whatsoever, except that an English
boy or girl may with grace remember that 'Old England,'
exactly and strictly so called, was the small district
in the extreme south of Denmark, totally with its
islands estimable at sixty miles square of dead flat land.
Directly south of it, the definitely so-called Saxons
held the western shore of Holstein, with the estuary
of the Elbe, and the sea-mark isle, Heligoland. But
since the principal temple of Saxon worship was close
to Leipsic,<a id="footnotetag9" name="footnotetag9"></a><a href="#footnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> we may include under our general term,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
Saxons, the inhabitants of the whole level district of
North Germany, from the Gulf of Flensburg to the
Hartz; and, eastward, all the country watered by the
Elbe as far as Saxon Switzerland.</p>

<p>Of the character of this race I will not here speak
at any length: only note of it this essential point, that
their religion was at once more practical and more imaginative
than that of the Norwegian peninsula; the
Norse religion being the conception rather of natural
than moral powers, but the Saxon, primarily of moral,
as the lords of natural&mdash;their central divine image,
Irminsul,<a id="footnotetag10" name="footnotetag10"></a><a href="#footnote10"><sup>10</sup></a> holding the standard of peace in her right
hand, a balance in her left. Such a religion may degenerate
into mere slaughter and rapine; but it has
the making in it of the noblest men.</p>

<p>More practical at all events, whether for good or
evil, in this trust in a future reward for courage and
purity, than the mere Scandinavian awe of existing
Earth and Cloud, the Saxon religion was also more
imaginative, in its nearer conception of human feeling
in divine creatures. And when this wide hope and
high reverence had distinct objects of worship and
prayer, offered to them by Christianity, the Saxons
easily became pure, passionate, and thoughtful Christians;
while the Normans, to the last, had the greatest
difficulty in apprehending the Christian teaching of the
Franks, and still deny the power of Christianity, even
when they have become inveterate in its form.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>

<p>Quite the deepest-thoughted creatures of the then
animate world, it seems to me, these Saxon ploughmen
of the sand or the sea, with their worshipped deity of
Beauty and Justice, a red rose on her banner, for best
of gifts, and in her right hand, instead of a sword, a
balance, for due doom, without wrath,&mdash;of retribution
in her left. Far other than the Wends, though stubborn
enough, they too, in battle rank,&mdash;seven times
rising from defeat against Charlemagne, and unsubdued
but by death&mdash;yet, by no means in that John Bull's
manner of yours, 'averse to be interfered with,' in their
opinions, or their religion. Eagerly docile on the
contrary&mdash;joyfully reverent&mdash;instantly and gratefully
acceptant of whatever better insight or oversight a
stranger could bring them, of the things of God or man.</p>

<p>And let me here ask you especially to take account
of that origin of the true bearing of the Flag of
England, the Red Rose. Her own madness defiled
afterwards alike the white and red, into images of the
paleness, or the crimson, of death; but the Saxon Rose
was the symbol of heavenly beauty and peace.</p>

<p>I told you in my first lecture that one swift requirement
in our school would be to produce a beautiful
map of England, including old Northumberland, giving
the whole country, in its real geography, between the
Frith of Forth and Straits of Dover, and with only six
sites of habitation given, besides those of Edinburgh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>
and London,&mdash;namely, those of Canterbury and Winchester,
York and Lancaster, Holy Island and Melrose;
the latter instead of Iona, because, as we have seen,
the influence of St. Columba expires with the advance
of Christianity, while that of Cuthbert of Melrose connects
itself with the most sacred feelings of the entire
Northumbrian kingdom, and Scottish border, down
to the days of Scott&mdash;wreathing also into its circle
many of the legends of Arthur. Will you forgive my
connecting the personal memory of having once had
a wild rose gathered for me, in the glen of Thomas the
Rhymer, by the daughter of one of the few remaining
Catholic houses of Scotland, with the pleasure I have
in reading to you this following true account of the
origin of the name of St. Cuthbert's birthplace;&mdash;the
rather because I owe it to friendship of the same date,
with Mr. Cockburn Muir, of Melrose.</p>

<p>"To those who have eyes to read it," says Mr. Muir,
"the name 'Melrose' is written full and fair, on the
fair face of all this reach of the valley. The name is
anciently spelt Mailros, and later, Malros, never Mulros;
('Mul' being the Celtic word taken to mean
'bare'). Ros is Rose; the forms Meal or Mol imply
great quantity or number. Thus Malros means the place of many roses.</p>

<p>"This is precisely the notable characteristic of the
neighbourhood. The wild rose is indigenous. There
is no nook nor cranny, no bank nor brae, which is not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
in the time of roses, ablaze with their exuberant loveliness.
In gardens, the cultured rose is so prolific that
it spreads literally like a weed. But it is worth suggestion
that the word may be of the same stock as the
Hebrew <i>rôsh</i> (translated rôs by the Septuagint), meaning
<i>chief</i>, <i>principal</i>, while it is also the name of <i>some</i>
flower; but of <i>which</i> flower is now unknown. Affinities
of <i>rôsh</i> are not far to seek; Sanskrit, <i>Raj</i>(a),
<i>Ra</i>(ja)<i>ni</i>; Latin, <i>Rex</i>, <i>Reg</i>(ina)."</p>

<p>I leave it to Professor Max Muller to certify or correct
for you the details of Mr. Cockburn's research,<a id="footnotetag11" name="footnotetag11"></a><a href="#footnote11"><sup>11</sup></a>&mdash;this
main head of it I can positively confirm, that in old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>
Scotch,&mdash;that of Bishop Douglas,&mdash;the word 'Rois'
stands alike for King, and Rose.</p>

<p>Summing now the features I have too shortly specified
in the Saxon character,&mdash;its imagination, its
docility, its love of knowledge, and its love of beauty,
you will be prepared to accept my conclusive statement,
that they gave rise to a form of Christian faith
which appears to me, in the present state of my knowledge,
one of the purest and most intellectual ever attained
in Christendom;&mdash;never yet understood, partly
because of the extreme rudeness of its expression in
the art of manuscripts, and partly because, on account
of its very purity, it sought no expression in architecture,
being a religion of daily life, and humble lodging.
For these two practical reasons, first;&mdash;and for this
more weighty third, that the intellectual character of it
is at the same time most truly, as Dean Stanley told
you, childlike; showing itself in swiftness of imaginative
apprehension, and in the fearlessly candid application
of great principles to small things. Its character
in this kind may be instantly felt by any sympathetic
and gentle person who will read carefully the book I
have already quoted to you, the Venerable Bede's life
of St. Cuthbert; and the intensity and sincerity of it
in the highest orders of the laity, by simply counting
the members of Saxon Royal families who ended their lives in monasteries.</p>

<p>Now, at the very moment when this faith, innocence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
and ingenuity were on the point of springing up into
their fruitage, comes the Northern invasion; of the
real character of which you can gain a far truer estimate
by studying Alfred's former resolute contest with
and victory over the native Norman in his paganism,
than by your utmost endeavours to conceive the character
of the afterwards invading Norman, disguised,
but not changed, by Christianity. The Norman could
not, in the nature of him, become a <i>Christian</i> at all;
and he never did;&mdash;he only became, at his best, the
enemy of the Saracen. What he was, and what alone
he was capable of being, I will try to-day to explain.</p>

<p>And here I must advise you that in all points of
history relating to the period between 800 and 1200,
you will find M. Viollet le Duc, incidentally throughout
his 'Dictionary of Architecture,' the best-informed,
most intelligent, and most thoughtful of guides. His
knowledge of architecture, carried down into the most
minutely practical details,&mdash;(which are often the most
significant), and embracing, over the entire surface of
France, the buildings even of the most secluded villages;
his artistic enthusiasm, balanced by the acutest
sagacity, and his patriotism, by the frankest candour,
render his analysis of history during that active and
constructive period the most valuable known to me,
and certainly, in its field, exhaustive. Of the later
nationality his account is imperfect, owing to his professional
interest in the mere <i>science</i> of architecture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>
and comparative insensibility to the power of sculpture;&mdash;but
of the time with which we are now concerned,
whatever he tells you must be regarded with grateful attention.</p>

<p>I introduce, therefore, the Normans to you, on their
first entering France, under his descriptive terms of them.<a id="footnotetag12" name="footnotetag12"></a><a href="#footnote12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>"As soon as they were established on the soil, these
barbarians became the most hardy and active builders.
Within the space of a century and a half, they had
covered the country on which they had definitely
landed, with religious, monastic, and civil edifices, of
an extent and richness then little common. It is difficult
to suppose that they had brought from Norway the
elements of art,<a id="footnotetag13" name="footnotetag13"></a><a href="#footnote13"><sup>13</sup></a> but they were possessed by a persisting
and penetrating spirit; their brutal force did
not want for grandeur. Conquerors, they raised castles
to assure their domination; they soon recognized the
Moral force of the clergy, and endowed it richly.
Eager always to attain their end, when once they saw
it, they <i>never left one of their enterprises unfinished</i>, and
in that they differed completely from the Southern
inhabitants of Gaul. Tenacious extremely, they were
perhaps the only ones among the barbarians established
in France who had ideas of order; the only ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
who knew how to preserve their conquests, and compose
a state. They found the remains of the Carthaginian
arts on the territory where they planted
themselves, they mingled with those their national
genius, positive, grand, and yet supple."</p>

<p>Supple, 'Delié,'&mdash;capable of change and play of the
mental muscle, in the way that savages are not. I do
not, myself, grant this suppleness to the Norman, the
less because another sentence of M. le Duc's, occurring
incidentally in his account of the archivolt, is of
extreme counter-significance, and wide application.
"The Norman arch," he says, "is <i>never derived from
traditional classic forms</i>, but only from mathematical
arrangement of line." Yes; that is true: the Norman
arch is never derived from classic forms. The cathedral,<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14"><sup>14</sup></a>
whose aisles you saw or might have seen, yesterday,
interpenetrated with light, whose vaults you might
have heard prolonging the sweet divisions of majestic
sound, would have been built in that stately symmetry
by Norman law, though never an arch at Rome had
risen round her field of blood,&mdash;though never her
Sublician bridge had been petrified by her Augustan
pontifices. But the <i>decoration</i>, though not the structure
of those arches, they owed to another race,<a id="footnotetag15" name="footnotetag15"></a><a href="#footnote15"><sup>15</sup></a>
whose words they stole without understanding, though
three centuries before, the Saxon understood, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>
used, to express the most solemn majesty of his Kinghood,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"EGO, EDGAR, TOTIVS ALBIONIS"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>not Rex, that would have meant the King of Kent or
Mercia, not of England,&mdash;no, nor Imperator; that
would have meant only the profane power of Rome,
but <i>BASILEVS</i>, meaning a King who reigned with
sacred authority given by Heaven and Christ.</p>

<p>With far meaner thoughts, both of themselves and
their powers, the Normans set themselves to build
impregnable military walls, and sublime religious ones,
in the best possible practical ways; but they no more
made books of their church fronts than of their bastion
flanks; and cared, in the religion they accepted, neither
for its sentiments nor its promises, but only for
its immediate results on national order.</p>

<p>As I read them, they were men wholly of this
world, bent on doing the most in it, and making the
best of it that they could;&mdash;men, to their death, of
<i>Deed</i>, never pausing, changing, repenting, or anticipating,
more than the completed square, ὰνευ ψογου, of
their battle, their keep, and their cloister. Soldiers
before and after everything, they learned the lockings
and bracings of their stones primarily in defence
against the battering-ram and the projectile, and esteemed
the pure circular arch for its distributed and
equal strength more than for its beauty. "I believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>
again," says M. le Duc,<a id="footnotetag16" name="footnotetag16"></a><a href="#footnote16"><sup>16</sup></a> "that the feudal castle never
arrived at its perfectness till after the Norman invasion,
and that this race of the North was the first to
apply a defensive system under unquestionable laws,
soon followed by the nobles of the Continent, after
they had, at their own expense, learned their superiority."</p>

<p>The next sentence is a curious one. I pray your
attention to it. "The defensive system of the Norman
is born of a profound sentiment of <i>distrust</i> and <i>cunning,
foreign to the character of the Frank</i>." You will find in
all my previous notices of the French, continual insistance
upon their natural Franchise, and also, if you take
the least pains in analysis of their literature down to
this day, that the idea of falseness is to them indeed
more hateful than to any other European nation. To
take a quite cardinal instance. If you compare Lucian's
and Shakespeare's Timon with Molière's Alceste, you
will find the Greek and English misanthropes dwell
only on men's <i>ingratitude</i> to <i>themselves</i>, but Alceste,
on their <i>falsehood to each other</i>.</p>

<p>Now hear M. le Duc farther:</p>

<p>"The castles built between the tenth and twelfth
centuries along the Loire, Gironde, and Seine, that is
to say, along the lines of the Norman invasions, and
in the neighbourhood of their possessions, have a
peculiar and uniform character which one finds neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
in central France, nor in Burgundy, nor can there be
any need for us to throw light on (<i>faire ressortir</i>) the
superiority of the warrior spirit of the Normans, during
the later times of the Carlovingian epoch, over the
spirit of the chiefs of Frank descent, established on
the Gallo-Roman soil." There's a bit of honesty in a
Frenchman for you!</p>

<p>I have just said that they valued religion chiefly for
its influence of order in the present world: being in
this, observe, as nearly as may be the exact reverse
of modern believers, or persons who profess to be
such,&mdash;of whom it may be generally alleged, too truly,
that they value religion with respect to their future
bliss rather than their present duty; and are therefore
continually careless of its direct commands, with easy
excuse to themselves for disobedience to them. Whereas
the Norman, finding in his own heart an irresistible
impulse to action, and perceiving himself to be set,
with entirely strong body, brain, and will, in the midst
of a weak and dissolute confusion of all things, takes
from the Bible instantly into his conscience every exhortation
to Do and to Govern; and becomes, with all
his might and understanding, a blunt and rough servant,
knecht, or knight of God, liable to much misapprehension,
of course, as to the services immediately
required of him, but supposing, since the whole make
of him, outside and in, is a soldier's, that God meant
him for a soldier, and that he is to establish, by main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
force, the Christian faith and works all over the world
so far as he comprehends them; not merely with the
Mahometan indignation against spiritual error, but
with a sound and honest soul's dislike of material error,
and resolution to extinguish <i>that</i>, even if perchance
found in the spiritual persons to whom, in their office,
he yet rendered total reverence.</p>

<p>Which force and faith in him I may best illustrate
by merely putting together the broken paragraphs of
Sismondi's account of the founding of the Norman
Kingdom of Sicily: virtually contemporary with the conquest of England.</p>

<p>"The Normans surpassed all the races of the west
in their ardour for pilgrimages. They would not, to
go into the Holy Land, submit to the monotony<a id="footnotetag17" name="footnotetag17"></a><a href="#footnote17"><sup>17</sup></a> of a
long sea voyage&mdash;the rather that they found not on
the Mediterranean the storms or dangers they had
rejoiced to encounter on their own sea. They traversed
by land the whole of France and Italy, trusting
to their swords to procure the necessary subsistence,<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18"><sup>18</sup></a>
if the charity of the faithful did not enough provide
for it with alms. The towns of Naples, Amalfi, Gaeta,
and Bari, held constant commerce with Syria; and frequent
miracles, it was believed, illustrated the Monte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>
Cassino (St. Benedict again!) on the road of Naples,
and the Mount of Angels (Garganus) above Bari."
(Querceta Gargani&mdash;verily, laborant; <i>now</i>, et orant.)
"The pilgrims wished to visit during their journey the
monasteries built on these two mountains, and therefore
nearly always, either going or returning to the
Holy Land, passed through Magna Græcia.</p>

<p>"In one of the earliest years of the eleventh century,
about forty of these religious travellers, having
returned from the Holy Land, chanced to have met
together in Salerno at the moment when a small Saracen
fleet came to insult the town, and demand of it
a military contribution. The inhabitants of South
Italy, at this time, abandoned to the delights of their
enchanted climate, had lost nearly all military courage.
The Salernitani saw with astonishment forty Norman
knights, after having demanded horses and arms from
the Prince of Salerno, order the gates of the town to
be opened, charge the Saracens fearlessly, and put
them to flight. The Salernitani followed, however, the
example given them by these brave warriors, and those
of the Mussulmans who escaped their swords were
forced to re-embark in all haste.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Salerno, Guaimar III., tried in vain
to keep the warrior-pilgrims at his court: but at his
solicitation other companies established themselves on
the rocks of Salerno and Amalfi, until, on Christmas
Day, 1041, (exactly a quarter of a century before the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
coronation here at Westminster of the Conqueror,)
they gathered their scattered forces at Aversa,<a id="footnotetag19" name="footnotetag19"></a><a href="#footnote19"><sup>19</sup></a> twelve
groups of them under twelve chosen counts, and all
under the Lombard Ardoin, as commander-in-chief."
Be so good as to note that,&mdash;a marvellous key-note
of historical fact about the unjesting Lombards, I
cannot find the total Norman number: the chief contingent,
under William of the Iron Arm, the son of
Tancred of Hauteville, was only of three hundred
knights; the Count of Aversa's troop, of the same
number, is named as an important part of the little
army&mdash;admit it for ten times Tancred's, three thousand
men in all. At Aversa, these three thousand
men form, coolly on Christmas Day, 1041, the design
of&mdash;well, I told you they didn't <i>design</i> much, only,
now we're here, we may as well, while we're about it,&mdash;overthrow
the Greek empire! That was their little
game!&mdash;a Christmas mumming to purpose. The following
year, the whole of Apulia was divided among them.</p>

<p>I will not spoil, by abstracting, the magnificent following
history of Robert Guiscard, the most wonderful
soldier of that or any other time: I leave you to finish
it for yourselves, only asking you to read together with
it, the sketch, in Turner's history of the Anglo-Saxons,
of Alfred's long previous war with the Norman Hasting;
pointing out to you for foci of character in each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
contest, the culminating incidents of naval battle. In
Guiscard's struggle with the Greeks, he encounters for
their chief naval force the Venetian fleet under the
Doge Domenico Selvo. The Venetians are at this
moment undoubted masters in all naval warfare; the
Normans are worsted easily the first day,&mdash;the second
day, fighting harder, they are defeated again, and so
disastrously that the Venetian Doge takes no precautions
against them on the third day, thinking them
utterly disabled. Guiscard attacks him again on the
third day, with the mere wreck of his own ships, and
defeats the tired and amazed Italians finally!</p>

<p>The sea-fight between Alfred's ships and those of
Hasting, ought to be still more memorable to us.
Alfred, as I noticed in last lecture, had built war ships
nearly twice as long as the Normans', swifter, and
steadier on the waves. Six Norman ships were ravaging
the Isle of Wight; Alfred sent nine of his own
to take them. The King's fleet found the Northmen's
embayed, and three of them aground. The three others
<i>engaged Alfred's nine, twice their size</i>; two of the Viking
ships were taken, but the third escaped, with only five
men! A nation which verily took its pleasures in its Deeds.</p>

<p>But before I can illustrate farther either their deeds
or their religion, I must for an instant meet the objection
which I suppose the extreme probity of the nineteenth
century must feel acutely against these men,&mdash;that
they all lived by thieving.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>

<p>Without venturing to allude to the <i>raison d'être</i> of
the present French and English Stock Exchanges, I
will merely ask any of you here, whether of Saxon or
Norman blood, to define for himself what he means by
the "possession of India." I have no doubt that you
all wish to keep India in order, and in like manner I
have assured you that Duke William wished to keep
England in order. If you will read the lecture on the
life of Sir Herbert Edwardes, which I hope to give in
London after finishing this course,<a id="footnotetag20" name="footnotetag20"></a><a href="#footnote20"><sup>20</sup></a> you will see how a
Christian British officer can, and does, verily, and with
his whole heart, keep in order such part of India as
may be entrusted to him, and in so doing, secure our
Empire. But the silent feeling and practice of the
nation about India is based on quite other motives than
Sir Herbert's. Every mutiny, every danger, every terror,
and every crime, occurring under, or paralyzing,
our Indian legislation, arises directly out of our national
desire to live on the loot of India, and the notion
always entertained by English young gentlemen and
ladies of good position, falling in love with each other
without immediate prospect of establishment in Belgrave
Square, that they can find in India, instantly on
landing, a bungalow ready furnished with the loveliest
fans, china, and shawls,&mdash;ices and sherbet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
command,&mdash;four-and-twenty slaves succeeding each other
hourly to swing the punkah, and a regiment with a
beautiful band to "keep order" outside, all round the house.</p>

<p>Entreating your pardon for what may seem rude in
these personal remarks, I will further entreat you to
read my account of the death of Cœur de Lion in the
third number of 'Fors Clavigera'&mdash;and also the scenes
in 'Ivanhoe' between Cœur de Lion and Locksley;
and commending these few passages to your quiet
consideration, I proceed to give you another anecdote
or two of the Normans in Italy, twelve years later than
those given above, and, therefore, only thirteen years
before the battle of Hastings.</p>

<p>Their division of South Italy among them especially,
and their defeat of Venice, had alarmed everybody
considerably,&mdash;especially the Pope, Leo IX., who did
not understand this manifestation of their piety. He
sent to Henry III. of Germany, to whom he owed his
Popedom, for some German knights, and got five hundred
spears; gathered out of all Apulia, Campania, and
the March of Ancona, what Greek and Latin troops
were to be had, to join his own army of the patrimony
of St. Peter; and the holy Pontiff, with this numerous
army, but no general, began the campaign by a pilgrimage
with all his troops to Monte Cassino, in order
to obtain, if it might be, St. Benedict for general.</p>

<p>Against the Pope's collected masses, with St. Benedict,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
their contemplative but at first inactive general,
stood the little army of Normans,&mdash;certainly not more
than the third of their number&mdash;but with Robert
Guiscard for captain, and under him his brother,
Humphrey of Hauteville, and Richard of Aversa. Not
in fear, but in devotion, they prayed the Pope 'avec
instance,'&mdash;to say on what conditions they could appease
his anger, and live in peace under him. But
the Pope would hear of nothing but their evacuation
of Italy. Whereupon, they had to settle the question in the Norman manner.</p>

<p>The two armies met in front of Civitella, on Waterloo
day, 18th June, thirteen years, as I said, before the
battle of Hastings. The German knights were the
heart of the Pope's army, but they were only five hundred;
the Normans surrounded <i>them</i> first, and slew
them, nearly to a man&mdash;and then made extremely
short work with the Italians and Greeks. The Pope,
with the wreck of them, fled into Civitella; but the
townspeople dared not defend their walls, and thrust
the Pope himself out of their gates&mdash;to meet, alone, the Norman army.</p>

<p>He met it, <i>not</i> alone, St. Benedict being with him
now, when he had no longer the strength of man to trust in.</p>

<p>The Normans, as they approached him, threw themselves
on their knees,&mdash;covered themselves with dust,
and implored his pardon and his blessing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>

<p>There's a bit of poetry&mdash;if you like,&mdash;but a piece
of steel-clad fact also, compared to which the battle
of Hastings and Waterloo both, were mere boys' squabbles.</p>

<p>You don't suppose, you British schoolboys, that <i>you</i>
overthrew Napoleon&mdash;<i>you?</i> Your prime Minister
folded up the map of Europe at the thought of him.
Not you, but the snows of Heaven, and the hand of
Him who dasheth in pieces with a rod of iron. He
casteth forth His ice like morsels,&mdash;who can stand before His cold?</p>

<p>But, so far as you have indeed the right to trust in
the courage of your own hearts, remember also&mdash;it is
not in Norman nor Saxon, but in Celtic race that your
real strength lies. The battles both of Waterloo and
Alma were won by Irish and Scots&mdash;by the terrible
Scots Greys, and by Sir Colin's Highlanders. Your
'thin red line,' was kept steady at Alma only by
Colonel Yea's swearing at them.</p>

<p>But the old Pope, alone against a Norman army,
wanted nobody to swear at him. Steady enough he,
having somebody to bless him, instead of swear at him.
St. Benedict, namely; whose (memory shall we say?)
helped him now at his pinch in a singular manner,&mdash;for
the Normans, having got the old man's forgiveness,
vowed themselves his feudal servants; and for seven
centuries afterwards the whole kingdom of Naples remained
a fief of St. Peter,&mdash;won for him thus by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
single man, unarmed, against three thousand Norman
knights, captained by Robert Guiscard!</p>

<p>A day of deeds, gentlemen, to some purpose,&mdash;<i>that</i> 18th of June, anyhow.</p>

<p>Here, in the historical account of Norman character,
I must unwillingly stop for to-day&mdash;because, as you
choose to spend your University money in building
ball-rooms instead of lecture-rooms, I dare not keep
you much longer in this black hole, with its nineteenth
century ventilation. I try your patience&mdash;and tax
your breath&mdash;only for a few minutes more in drawing
the necessary corollaries respecting Norman art.<a id="footnotetag21" name="footnotetag21"></a><a href="#footnote21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p>How far the existing British nation owes its military
prowess to the blood of Normandy and Anjou, I have
never examined its genealogy enough to tell you;&mdash;but
this I can tell you positively, that whatever constitutional
order or personal valour the Normans enforced
or taught among the nations they conquered, they did
not at first attempt with their own hands to rival them
in any of their finer arts, but used both Greek and
Saxon sculptors, either as slaves, or hired workmen,
and more or less therefore chilled and degraded the
hearts of the men thus set to servile, or at best, hireling, labour.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>

<p>In 1874, I went to see Etna, Scylla, Charybdis, and
the tombs of the Norman Kings at Palermo; surprised,
as you may imagine, to find that there wasn't a stroke
nor a notion of Norman work in them. They are,
every atom, done by Greeks, and are as pure Greek as
the temple of Ægina; but more rich and refined. I
drew with accurate care, and with measured profile of
every moulding, the tomb built for Roger II. (afterwards
Frederick II. was laid in its dark porphyry).
And it is a perfect type of the Greek-Christian form
of tomb&mdash;temple over sarcophagus, in which the pediments
rise gradually, as time goes on, into acute
angles&mdash;get pierced in the gable with foils, and their
sculptures thrown outside on their flanks, and become
at last in the fourteenth century, the tombs of Verona.
But what is the meaning of the Normans employing
these Greek slaves for their work in Sicily (within
thirty miles of the field of Himera)? Well, the main
meaning is that though the Normans could build, they
couldn't carve, and were wise enough not to try to,
when they couldn't, as you do now all over this intensely
comic and tragic town: but, here in England,
they only employed the Saxon with a grudge, and
therefore being more and more driven to use barren
mouldings without sculpture, gradually developed the
structural forms of archivolt, which breaking into the
lancet, brighten and balance themselves into the symmetry
of early English Gothic.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>

<p>But even for the first decoration of the archivolt
itself, they were probably indebted to the Greeks in
a degree I never apprehended, until by pure happy
chance, a friend gave me the clue to it just as I was
writing the last pages of this lecture.</p>

<p>In the generalization of ornament attempted in the
first volume of the 'Stones of Venice,' I supposed the
Norman <i>zigzag</i> (and with some practical truth) to be
derived from the angular notches with which the blow
of an axe can most easily decorate, or at least vary,
the solid edge of a square fillet. My good friend, and
supporter, and for some time back the single trustee
of St. George's Guild, Mr. George Baker, having come
to Oxford on Guild business, I happened to show him
the photographs of the front of Iffley church, which
had been collected for this lecture; and immediately
afterwards, in taking him through the schools, stopped
to show him the Athena of Ægina as one of the most
important of the Greek examples lately obtained for us
by Professor Richmond. The statue is (rightly) so
placed that in looking up to it, the plait of hair across
the forehead is seen in a steeply curved arch. "Why,"
says Mr. Baker, pointing to it, "there's the Norman
arch of Iffley." Sure enough, there it exactly was:
and a moment's reflection showed me how easily, and
with what instinctive fitness, the Norman builders,
looking to the Greeks as their absolute masters in
sculpture, and recognizing also, during the Crusades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
the hieroglyphic use of the zigzag, for water, by the
Egyptians, might have adopted this easily attained
decoration at once as the sign of the element over
which they reigned, and of the power of the Greek
goddess who ruled both it and them.</p>

<p>I do not in the least press your acceptance of such
a tradition, nor for the rest, do I care myself whence
any method of ornament is derived, if only, as a stranger,
you bid it reverent welcome. But much probability
is added to the conjecture by the indisputable
transition of the Greek egg and arrow moulding into
the floral cornices of Saxon and other twelfth century
cathedrals in Central France. These and other such
transitions and exaltations I will give you the materials
to study at your leisure, after illustrating in my next
lecture the forces of religious imagination by which all
that was most beautiful in them was inspired.</p>

<h2>LECTURE IV.</h2>

<h2>(<i>Nov.</i> 8, 1884.)</h2>

<h2>THE PLEASURES OF FANCY.</h2>

<h3><i>Cœur de Lion to Elizabeth</i></h3>

<h3>(1189 to 1558).</h3>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>

<p>In using the word "Fancy," for the mental faculties
of which I am to speak to-day, I trust you, at your
leisure, to read the Introductory Note to the second
volume of 'Modern Painters' in the small new edition,
which gives sufficient reason for practically including
under the single term Fancy, or Fantasy, all the energies
of the Imagination,&mdash;in the terms of the last sentence
of that preface,&mdash;"the healthy, voluntary, and
necessary,<a id="footnotetag22" name="footnotetag22"></a><a href="#footnote22"><sup>22</sup></a> action of the highest powers of the human
mind, on subjects properly demanding and justifying their exertion."</p>

<p>I must farther ask you to read, in the same volume,
the close of the chapter 'Of Imagination Penetrative,'
pp. 120 to 130, of which the gist, which I must give as
the first principle from which we start in our to-day's
inquiry, is that "Imagination, rightly so called, has no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
food, no delight, no care, no perception, except of
truth; it is for ever looking under masks, and burning
up mists; no fairness of form, no majesty of seeming,
will satisfy it; the first condition of its existence is
incapability of being deceived."<a id="footnotetag23" name="footnotetag23"></a><a href="#footnote23"><sup>23</sup></a> In that sentence,
which is a part, and a very valuable part, of the original
book, I still adopted and used unnecessarily the
ordinary distinction between Fancy and Imagination&mdash;Fancy
concerned with lighter things, creating fairies or
centaurs, and Imagination creating men; and I was in
the habit always of implying by the meaner word
Fancy, a voluntary Fallacy, as Wordsworth does in
those lines to his wife, making of her a mere lay figure
for the drapery of his fancy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Such if thou wert, in all men's view</p>
<p class="i2">An universal show,</p>
<p>What would my Fancy have to do,</p>
<p class="i2">My feelings to bestow.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But you will at once understand the higher and more
universal power which I now wish you to understand
by the Fancy, including all imaginative energy, correcting
these lines of Wordsworth's to a more worthy
description of a true lover's happiness. When a boy
falls in love with a girl, you say he has taken a fancy
for her; but if he love her rightly, that is to say for
her noble qualities, you ought to say he has taken an
imagination for her; for then he is endued with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
new light of love which sees and tells of the mind in
her,&mdash;and this neither falsely nor vainly. His love
does not bestow, it discovers, what is indeed most
precious in his mistress, and most needful for his own
life and happiness. Day by day, as he loves her better,
he discerns her more truly; and it is only the truth
of his love that does so. Falsehood to her, would at
once disenchant and blind him.</p>

<p>In my first lecture of this year, I pointed out to you
with what extreme simplicity and reality the Christian
faith must have presented itself to the Northern
Pagan's mind, in its distinction from his former confused
and monstrous mythology. It was also in that
simplicity and tangible reality of conception, that this
Faith became to them, and to the other savage nations
of Europe, Tutress of the real power of their imagination
and it became so, only in so far as it indeed conveyed
to them statements which, however in some respects
mysterious, were yet most literally and brightly
<i>true</i>, as compared with their former conceptions. So
that while the blind cunning of the savage had produced
only misshapen logs or scrawls; the <i>seeing</i> imagination
of the Christian painters created, for them and
for all the world, the perfect types of the Virgin and
of her Son; which became, indeed, Divine, by being,
with the most affectionate truth, human.</p>

<p>And the association of this truth in loving conception,
with the general honesty and truth of the character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
is again conclusively shown in the feelings of the
lover to his mistress; which we recognize as first reaching
their height in the days of chivalry. The truth
and faith of the lover, and his piety to Heaven, are
the foundation, in his character, of all the joy in imagination
which he can receive from the conception of
his lady's&mdash;now no more mortal&mdash;beauty. She is indeed
transfigured before him; but the truth of the
transfiguration is greater than that of the lightless
aspect she bears to others. When therefore, in my
next lecture, I speak of the Pleasures of Truth, as
distinct from those of the Imagination,&mdash;if either the
limits or clearness of brief title had permitted me, I
should have said, <i>untransfigured</i> truth;&mdash;meaning on
the one side, truth which we have not heart enough to
transfigure, and on the other, truth of the lower kind
which is incapable of transfiguration. One may look
at a girl till one believes she is an angel; because, in
the best of her, she <i>is</i> one; but one can't look at a
cockchafer till one believes it is a girl.</p>

<p>With this warning of the connection which exists
between the honest intellect and the healthy imagination;
and using henceforward the shorter word
'Fancy' for all inventive vision, I proceed to consider
with you the meaning and consequences of the frank
and eager exertion of the fancy on Religious subjects,
between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Its first, and admittedly most questionable action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
the promotion of the group of martyr saints of the
third century to thrones of uncontested dominion in
heaven, had better be distinctly understood, before we
debate of it, either with the Iconoclast or the Rationalist.
This apotheosis by the Imagination is the subject
of my present lecture. To-day I only describe it,&mdash;in
my next lecture I will discuss it.</p>

<p>Observe, however, that in giving such a history of
the mental constitution of nascent Christianity, we
have to deal with, and carefully to distinguish, two
entirely different orders in its accepted hierarchy:&mdash;one,
scarcely founded at all on personal characters or
acts, but mythic or symbolic; often merely the revival,
the baptized resuscitation of a Pagan deity, or the
personified omnipresence of a Christian virtue;&mdash;the
other, a senate of Patres Conscripti of real persons,
great in genius, and perfect, humanly speaking, in holiness;
who by their personal force and inspired wisdom,
wrought the plastic body of the Church into such
noble form as in each of their epochs it was able to
receive; and on the right understanding of whose
lives, nor less of the affectionate traditions which magnified
and illumined their memories, must absolutely
depend the value of every estimate we form, whether
of the nature of the Christian Church herself, or of the
directness of spiritual agency by which she was guided.<a id="footnotetag24" name="footnotetag24"></a><a href="#footnote24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>

<p>An important distinction, therefore, is to be noted
at the outset, in the objects of this Apotheosis, according
as they are, or are not, real persons.</p>

<p>Of these two great orders of Saints, the first; or
mythic, belongs&mdash;speaking broadly&mdash;to the southern or Greek Church alone.</p>

<p>The Gothic Christians, once detached from the worship
of Odin and Thor, abjure from their hearts all
trust in the elements, and all worship of ideas. They
will have their Saints in flesh and blood, their Angels
in plume and armour; and nothing incorporeal or
invisible. In all the Religious sculpture beside Loire
and Seine, you will not find either of the great rivers
personified; the dress of the highest seraph is of true
steel or sound broadcloth, neither flecked by hail, nor
fringed by thunder; and while the ideal Charity of
Giotto at Padua presents her heart in her hand to God,
and tramples at the same instant on bags of gold, the
treasures of the world, and gives only corn and flowers;
that on the west porch of Amiens is content to
clothe a beggar with a piece of the staple manufacture of the town.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it is nearly impossible to find in the
imagery of the Greek Church, under the former exercise
of the Imagination, a representation either of man
or beast which purports to represent <i>only</i> the person,
or the brute. Every mortal creature stands for an Immortal
Intelligence or Influence: a Lamb means an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
Apostle, a Lion an Evangelist, an Angel the Eternal
justice or benevolence; and the most historical and
indubitable of Saints are compelled to set forth, in
their vulgarly apparent persons, a Platonic myth or an Athanasian article.</p>

<p>I therefore take note first of the mythic saints in
succession, whom this treatment of them by the
Byzantine Church made afterwards the favourite idols of all Christendom.</p>

<p>I. The most mythic is of course St. Sophia; the
shade of the Greek Athena, passing into the 'Wisdom'
of the Jewish Proverbs and Psalms, and the Apocryphal
'Wisdom of Solomon.' She always remains
understood as a personification only; and has no direct
influence on the mind of the unlearned multitude of
Western Christendom, except as a godmother,&mdash;in
which kindly function she is more and more accepted
as times go on; her healthy influence being perhaps
greater over sweet vicars' daughters in Wakefield&mdash;when
Wakefield <i>was</i>,&mdash;than over the prudentest of the
rarely prudent Empresses of Byzantium.</p>

<p>II. Of St. Catharine of Egypt there are vestiges of
personal tradition which may perhaps permit the supposition
of her having really once existed, as a very
lovely, witty, proud, and 'fanciful' girl. She afterwards
becomes the Christian type of the Bride, in the
'Song of Solomon,' involved with an ideal of all that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
purest in the life of a nun, and brightest in the death
of a martyr. It is scarcely possible to overrate the influence
of the conceptions formed of her, in ennobling
the sentiments of Christian women of the higher
orders;&mdash;to their practical common sense, as the mistresses
of a household or a nation, her example may
have been less conducive.</p>

<p>III. St. Barbara, also an Egyptian, and St. Catharine's
contemporary, though the most practical of the
mythic saints, is also, after St. Sophia, the least corporeal:
she vanishes far away into the 'Inclusa Danae,'
and her "Tunis aenea" becomes a myth of Christian
safety, of which the Scriptural significance may be
enough felt by merely looking out the texts under the
word "Tower," in your concordance; and whose effectual
power, in the fortitudes alike of matter and spirit,
was in all probability made impressive enough to all
Christendom, both by the fortifications and persecutions
of Diocletian. I have endeavoured to mark her
general relations to St. Sophia in the little imaginary
dialogue between them, given in the eighth lecture of
the 'Ethics of the Dust.'</p>

<p>Afterwards, as Gothic architecture becomes dominant,
and at last beyond question the most wonderful
of all temple-building, St. Barbara's Tower is, of
course, its perfected symbol and utmost achievement;
and whether in the coronets of countless battlements
worn on the brows of the noblest cities, or in the Lombard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
bell-tower on the mountains, and the English
spire on Sarum plain, the geometric majesty of the
Egyptian maid became glorious in harmony of
defence, and sacred with precision of symbol.</p>

<p>As the buildings which showed her utmost skill were
chiefly exposed to lightning, she is invoked in defence
from it; and our petition in the Litany, against sudden
death, was written originally to her. The blasphemous
corruptions of her into a patroness of cannon and gunpowder,
are among the most ludicrous, (because precisely
contrary to the original tradition,) as well as the most
deadly, insolences and stupidities of Renaissance Art.</p>

<p>IV. St. Margaret of Antioch was a shepherdess;
the St. Geneviève of the East; the type of feminine
gentleness and simplicity. Traditions of the resurrection
of Alcestis perhaps mingle in those of her
contest with the dragon; but at all events, she differs
from the other three great mythic saints, in expressing
the soul's victory over temptation or affliction,
by Christ's miraculous help, and without any special
power of its own. She is the saint of the meek and
of the poor; her virtue and her victory are those of
all gracious and lowly womanhood; and her memory
is consecrated among the gentle households of Europe;
no other name, except those of Jeanne and Jeanie,
seems so gifted with a baptismal fairy power of giving
grace and peace.</p>

<p>I must be forgiven for thinking, even on this canonical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
ground, not only of Jeanie Deans, and Margaret
of Branksome; but of Meg&mdash;Merrilies. My readers
will, I fear, choose rather to think of the more doubtful
victory over the Dragon, won by the great Margaret
of German literature.</p>

<p>V. With much more clearness and historic comfort
we may approach the shrine of St. Cecilia; and even
on the most prosaic and realistic minds&mdash;such as my
own&mdash;a visit to her house in Rome has a comforting
and establishing effect, which reminds one of the
carter in 'Harry and Lucy,' who is convinced of the
truth of a plaustral catastrophe at first incredible to
him, as soon as he hears the name of the hill on which
it happened. The ruling conception of her is deepened
gradually by the enlarged study of Religious
music; and is at its best and highest in the thirteenth
century, when she rather resists than complies
with the already tempting and distracting powers of
sound; and we are told that "cantantibus organis,
Cecilia virgo in corde suo soli Domino decantabat,
dicens, 'Fiat, Domine, cor meum et corpus meum
immaculatum, ut non confundar.'"</p>

<p>("While the instruments played, Cecilia the virgin
sang in her heart only to the Lord, saying, Oh Lord,
be my heart and body made stainless, that I be not
confounded.")</p>

<p>This sentence occurs in my great Service-book of
the convent of Beau-pré, written in 1290, and it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
illustrated with a miniature of Cecilia sitting silent at
a banquet, where all manner of musicians are playing.
I need not point out to you how the law, not of
sacred music only, so called, but of <i>all</i> music, is determined
by this sentence; which means in effect that
unless music exalt and purify, it is not under St. Cecilia's
ordinance, and it is not, virtually, music at all.</p>

<p>Her confessed power at last expires amidst a hubbub
of odes and sonatas; and I suppose her presence
at a Morning Popular is as little anticipated as desired.
Unconfessed, she is of all the mythic saints for ever
the greatest; and the child in its nurse's arms, and
every tender and gentle spirit which resolves to purify
in itself,&mdash;as the eye for seeing, so the ear for hearing,&mdash;may
still, whether behind the Temple veil,<a id="footnotetag25" name="footnotetag25"></a><a href="#footnote25"><sup>25</sup></a> or at
the fireside, and by the wayside, hear Cecilia sing.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>

<p>It would delay me too long just now to trace in
specialty farther the functions of the mythic, or, as in
another sense they may be truly called, the universal,
Saints: the next greatest of them, St. Ursula, is essentially
British,&mdash;and you will find enough about her in
'Fors Clavigera'; the others, I will simply give you in
entirely authoritative order from the St. Louis' Psalter,
as he read and thought of them.</p>

<p>The proper Service-book of the thirteenth century
consists first of the pure Psalter; then of certain essential
passages of the Old Testament&mdash;invariably the
Song of Miriam at the Red Sea and the last song of
Moses;&mdash;ordinarily also the 12th of Isaiah and the
prayer of Habakkuk; while St. Louis' Psalter has also
the prayer of Hannah, and that of Hezekiah (Isaiah
xxxviii. 10-20); the Song of the Three Children; then
the Benedictus, the Magnificat, and the Nunc Dimittis.
Then follows the Athanasian Creed; and then, as in
all Psalters after their chosen Scripture passages, the
collects to the Virgin, the Te Deum, and Service to
Christ, beginning with the Psalm 'The Lord reigneth';
and then the collects to the greater individual saints,
closing with the Litany, or constant prayer for mercy
to Christ, and all saints; of whom the order is,&mdash;Archangels,
Patriarchs, Apostles, Disciples, Innocents, Martyrs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
Confessors, Monks, and Virgins. Of women the
Magdalen <i>always</i> leads; St. Mary of Egypt usually
follows, but <i>may</i> be the last. Then the order varies in
every place, and prayer-book, no recognizable supremacy
being traceable; except in relation to the place,
or person, for whom the book was written. In St.
Louis', St. Geneviève (the last saint to whom he
prayed on his death-bed) follows the two Maries; then
come&mdash;memorable for you best, as easiest, in this six-foil
group,&mdash;Saints Catharine, Margaret, and Scolastica,
Agatha, Cecilia, and Agnes; and then ten more,
whom you may learn or not as you like: I note them
now only for future reference,&mdash;more lively and easy
for your learning,&mdash;by their French names,</p>

<center>Felicité,</center>

<center>Colombe,</center>

<center>Christine,</center>

<center>&mdash;&mdash;</center>

<center>Aurée, Honorine,</center>

<center>&mdash;&mdash;</center>

<center>Radegonde,</center>

<center>Praxède,</center>

<center>Euphémie,</center>

<center>&mdash;&mdash;</center>

<center>Bathilde, Eugénie.</center>

<p>Such was the system of Theology into which the
Imaginative Religion of Europe was crystallized, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
the growth of its own best faculties, and the influence
of all accessible and credible authorities, during the
period between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries
inclusive. Its spiritual power is completely represented
by the angelic and apostolic dynasties, and the
women-saints in Paradise; for of the men-saints, beneath
the apostles and prophets, none but St. Christopher,
St. Nicholas, St. Anthony, St. James, and St.
George, attained anything like the influence of Catharine
or Cecilia; for the very curious reason, that the
men-saints were much more true, real, and numerous.
St. Martin was reverenced all over Europe, but definitely,
as a man, and the Bishop of Tours. So St.
Ambrose at Milan, and St. Gregory at Rome, and hundreds
of good men more, all over the world; while the
really good women remained, though not rare, inconspicuous.
The virtues of French Clotilde, and Swiss
Berthe, were painfully borne down in the balance of
visible judgment, by the guilt of the Gonerils, Regans,
and Lady Macbeths, whose spectral procession closes
only with the figure of Eleanor in Woodstock maze;
and in dearth of nearer objects, the daily brighter
powers of fancy dwelt with more concentrated devotion
on the stainless ideals of the earlier maid-martyrs.
And observe, even the loftier fame of the men-saints
above named, as compared with the rest, depends on
precisely the same character of indefinite personality;
and on the representation, by each of them, of a moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
idea which may be embodied and painted in a miraculous
legend; credible, as history, even then, only to the
vulgar; but powerful over them, nevertheless, exactly
in proportion to the degree in which it can be pictured
and fancied as a living creature. Consider even
yet in these days of mechanism, how the dullest John
Bull cannot with perfect complacency adore <i>himself</i>,
except under the figure of Britannia or the British
Lion; and how the existence of the popular jest-book,
which might have seemed secure in its necessity to
our weekly recreation, is yet virtually centred on the
imaginary animation of a puppet, and the imaginary
elevation to reason of a dog. But in the Middle Ages,
this action of the Fancy, now distorted and despised,
was the happy and sacred tutress of every faculty of
the body and soul; and the works and thoughts
of art, the joys and toils of men, rose and flowed on
in the bright air of it, with the aspiration of a flame,
and the beneficence of a fountain.</p>

<p>And now, in the rest of my lecture, I had intended
to give you a broad summary of the rise and fall of
English art, born under this code of theology, and this
enthusiasm of duty;&mdash;of its rise, from the rude vaults
of Westminster, to the finished majesty of Wells;&mdash;and
of its fall, from that brief hour of the thirteenth
century, through the wars of the Bolingbroke, and the
pride of the Tudor, and the lust of the Stewart, to
expire under the mocking snarl and ruthless blow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
the Puritan. But you know that I have always, in
my most serious work, allowed myself to be influenced
by those Chances, as they are now called,&mdash;but to my
own feeling and belief, guidances, and even, if rightly
understood, commands,&mdash;which, as far as I have read
history, the best and sincerest men think providential.
Had this lecture been on common principles of
art, I should have finished it as I intended, without
fear of its being the worse for my consistency. But it
deals, on the contrary, with a subject, respecting
which every sentence I write, or speak, is of importance
in its issue; and I allowed, as you heard, the
momentary observation of a friend, to give an
entirely new cast to the close of my last lecture.
Much more, I feel it incumbent upon me in this
one, to take advantage of the most opportune help,
though in an unexpected direction, given me by my
constant tutor, Professor Westwood. I went to dine
with him, a day or two ago, mainly&mdash;being neither of
us, I am thankful to say, blue-ribanded&mdash;to drink his
health on his recovery from his recent accident.
Whereupon he gave me a feast of good talk, old
wine, and purple manuscripts. And having had as
much of all as I could well carry, just as it came
to the good-night, out he brings, for a finish, this
leaf of manuscript in my hand, which he has lent
me to show you,&mdash;a leaf of the Bible of Charles the Bald!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>

<p>A leaf of it, at least, as far as you or I could tell,
for Professor Westwood's copy is just as good, in all
the parts finished, as the original: and, for all practical
purpose, I show you here in my hand a leaf of
the Bible which your own King Alfred saw with his
own bright eyes, and from which he learned his child-faith
in the days of dawning thought!</p>

<p>There are few English children who do not know
the story of Alfred, the king, letting the cakes burn,
and being chidden by his peasant hostess. How few
English children&mdash;nay, how few perhaps of their
educated, not to say learned, elders&mdash;reflect upon, if
even they know, the far different scenes through which
he had passed when a child!</p>

<p>Concerning his father, his mother, and his own
childhood, suppose you were to teach your children
first these following main facts, before you come to
the toasting of the muffin?</p>

<p>His father, educated by Helmstan, Bishop of Winchester,
had been offered the throne of the great
Saxon kingdom of Mercia in his early youth; had
refused it, and entered, as a novice under St. Swithin
the monastery at Winchester. From St. Swithin, he
received the monastic habit, and was appointed by
Bishop Helmstan one of his sub-deacons!</p>

<p>"The quiet seclusion which Ethelwulph's slow<a id="footnotetag26" name="footnotetag26"></a><a href="#footnote26"><sup>26</sup></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
capacity and meek temper coveted" was not permitted
to him by fate. The death of his elder brother left
him the only living representative of the line of the
West Saxon princes. His accession to the throne
became the desire of the people. He obtained a dispensation
from the Pope to leave the cloister;
assumed the crown of Egbert; and retained Egbert's
prime minister, Alstan, Bishop of Sherborne, who was
the Minister in peace and war, the Treasurer, and the
Counsellor, of the kings of England, over a space, from
first to last, of fifty years.</p>

<p>Alfred's mother, Osburga, must have been married
for love. She was the daughter of Oslac, the king's
cup-bearer. Extolled for her piety and understanding,
she bore the king four sons; dying before the
last, Alfred, was five years old, but leaving him St.
Swithin for his tutor. How little do any of us think,
in idle talk of rain or no rain on St. Swithin's day, that
we speak of the man whom Alfred's father obeyed
as a monk, and whom his mother chose for his guardian!</p>

<p>Alfred, both to father and mother, was the best
beloved of their children. On his mother's death, his
father sent him, being then five years old, with a great
retinue through France and across the Alps to Rome;
and there the Pope anointed him King, (heir-apparent
to the English throne), at the request of his father.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>

<p>Think of it, you travellers through the Alps by
tunnels, that you may go to balls at Rome or hells at
Monaco. Here is another manner of journey, another
goal for it, appointed for your little king. At twelve,
he was already the best hunter among the Saxon
youths. Be sure he could sit his horse at five. Fancy
the child, with his keen genius, and holy heart, riding
with his Saxon chiefs beside him, by the Alpine flowers
under Velan or Sempione, and down among the
olives to Pavia, to Perugia, to Rome; there, like the
little fabled Virgin, ascending the Temple steps, and
consecrated to be King of England by the great Leo,
Leo of the Leonine city, the saviour of Rome from the Saracen.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards, he rode again to Rome
beside his father; the West Saxon king bringing
presents to the Pope, a crown of pure gold weighing
four pounds, a sword adorned with pure gold, two
golden images,<a id="footnotetag27" name="footnotetag27"></a><a href="#footnote27"><sup>27</sup></a> four Saxon silver dishes; and giving
a gift of gold to all the Roman clergy and nobles,<a id="footnotetag28" name="footnotetag28"></a><a href="#footnote28"><sup>28</sup></a>
and of silver to the people.</p>

<p>No idle sacrifices or symbols, these gifts of courtesy!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
The Saxon King rebuilt on the highest hill
that is bathed by Tiber, the Saxon street and school,
the Borgo,<a id="footnotetag29" name="footnotetag29"></a><a href="#footnote29"><sup>29</sup></a> of whose miraculously arrested burning
Raphael's fresco preserves the story to this day. And
further he obtained from Leo the liberty of all Saxon
men from bonds in penance;&mdash;a first phase this of
Magna Charta, obtained more honourably, from a
more honourable person, than that document, by
which Englishmen of this day, suppose they live, move, and have being.</p>

<p>How far into Alfred's soul, at seven years old, sank
any true image of what Rome was, and had been;
of what her Lion Lord was, who had saved her from
the Saracen, and her Lion Lord had been, who had
saved her from the Hun; and what this Spiritual
Dominion was, and was to be, which could make and
unmake kings, and save nations, and put armies to
flight; I leave those to say, who have learned to reverence
childhood. This, at least, is sure, that the days
of Alfred were bound each to each, not only by their
natural piety, but by the actual presence and appeal
to his heart, of all that was then in the world most
noble, beautiful, and strong against Death.</p>

<p>In this living Book of God he had learned to read,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
thus early; and with perhaps nobler ambition than
of getting the prize of a gilded psalm-book at his
mother's knee, as you are commonly told of him.
What sort of psalm-book it was, however, you may
see from this leaf in my hand. For, as his father
and he returned from Rome that year, they stayed
again at the Court of Charlemagne's grandson, whose
daughter, the Princess Judith, Ethelwolf was wooing
for Queen of England, (not queen-consort, merely, but
crowned queen, of authority equal to his own.) From
whom Alfred was like enough to have had a reading
lesson or two out of her father's Bible; and like
enough, the little prince, to have stayed her hand at
this bright leaf of it, the Lion-leaf, bearing the symbol
of the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</p>

<p>You cannot, of course, see anything but the glittering
from where you sit; nor even if you afterwards
look at it near, will you find a figure the least admirable
or impressive to you. It is not like Landseer's
Lions in Trafalgar Square; nor like Tenniel's in
'Punch'; still less like the real ones in Regent's
Park. Neither do I show it you as admirable in any
respect of art, other than that of skilfullest illumination.
I show it you, as the most interesting Gothic
type of the imagination of Lion; which, after the
Roman Eagle, possessed the minds of all European
warriors; until, as they themselves grew selfish and
cruel, the symbols which at first meant heaven-sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
victory, or the strength and presence of some Divine
spirit, became to them only the signs of their own
pride or rage: the victor raven of Corvus sinks into
the shamed falcon of Marmion, and the lion-heartedness
which gave the glory and the peace of the gods
to Leonidas, casts the glory and the might of kinghood
to the dust before Chalus.<a id="footnotetag30" name="footnotetag30"></a><a href="#footnote30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p>That death, 6th April, 1199, ended the advance of
England begun by Alfred, under the pure law of Religious
Imagination. She began, already, in the thirteenth
century, to be decoratively, instead of vitally,
religious. The history of the Religious Imagination
expressed between Alfred's time and that of Cœur de
Lion, in this symbol of the Lion only, has material in
it rather for all my seven lectures than for the closing
section of one; but I must briefly specify to you
the main sections of it. I will keep clear of my favourite
number seven, and ask you to recollect the
meaning of only Five, Mythic Lions.</p>

<p>First of all, in Greek art, remember to keep yourselves
clear about the difference between the Lion and the Gorgon.</p>

<p>The Gorgon is the power of evil in heaven, conquered
by Athena, and thenceforward becoming her
ægis, when she is herself the inflictor of evil. Her
helmet is then the helmet of Orcus.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>

<p>But the Lion is the power of death on earth, conquered
by Heracles, and becoming thenceforward both
his helmet and ægis. All ordinary architectural lion
sculpture is derived from the Heraclean.</p>

<p>Then the Christian Lions are, first, the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah&mdash;Christ Himself as Captain and Judge:
"He shall rule the nations with a rod of iron," (the
opposite power of His adversary, is rarely intended
in sculpture unless in association with the serpent&mdash;"inculcabis
supra leonem et aspidem"); secondly,
the Lion of St. Mark, the power of the Gospel going
out to conquest; thirdly, the Lion of St. Jerome, the
wrath of the brute creation changed into love by the
kindness of man; and, fourthly, the Lion of the Zodiac,
which is the Lion of Egypt and of the Lombardic
pillar-supports in Italy; these four, if you remember,
with the Nemean Greek one, five altogether, will give
you, broadly, interpretation of nearly all Lion symbolism
in great art. How they degenerate into the
British door knocker, I leave you to determine for
yourselves, with such assistances as I may be able to
suggest to you in my next lecture; but, as the grotesqueness
of human history plans it, there is actually
a connection between that last degradation of the
Leonine symbol, and its first and noblest significance.</p>

<p>You see there are letters round this golden Lion
of Alfred's spelling-book, which his princess friend was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
likely enough to spell for him. They are two Latin hexameters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hic Leo, surgendo, portas confregit Averni</p>
<p>Qui nunquam dormit, nusquam dormitat, in ævum.</p>
<p>(This Lion, rising, burst the gates of Death:</p>
<p>This, who sleeps not, nor shall sleep, for ever.)</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now here is the Christian change of the Heraclean
conquest of Death into Christ's Resurrection. Samson's
bearing away the gates of Gaza is another like
symbol, and to the mind of Alfred, taught, whether
by the Pope Leo for his schoolmaster, or by the great-granddaughter
of Charlemagne for his schoolmistress,
it represented, as it did to all the intelligence of
Christendom, Christ in His own first and last, Alpha
and Omega, description of Himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am He that liveth and was dead, and behold I
am alive for evermore, and <i>have the keys</i> of Hell and
of Death." And in His servant St. John's description of Him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is the Faithful Witness and the First-begotten
of the dead, and the Prince of the kings of the earth."</p>

<p>All this assuredly, so far as the young child, consecrated
like David, the youngest of his brethren, conceived
his own new life in Earth and Heaven,&mdash;he
understood already in the Lion symbol. But of all
this I had no thought<a id="footnotetag31" name="footnotetag31"></a><a href="#footnote31"><sup>31</sup></a> when I chose the prayer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
Alfred as the type of the Religion of his era, in its
dwelling, not on the deliverance from the punishment
of sin, but from the poisonous sleep and death of it.
Will you ever learn that prayer again,&mdash;youths who
are to be priests, and knights, and kings of England,
in these the latter days? when the gospel of Eternal
Death is preached here in Oxford to you for the
Pride of Truth? and "the mountain of the Lord's
House" has become a Golgotha, and the "new song
before the throne" sunk into the rolling thunder of
the death rattle of the Nations, crying, "O Christ, where is Thy Victory!"</p>

"The ancient Cognizance of the town confirms this etymology beyond doubt,

simply the Queen, the Chief? Now, so few who know Keltic know also
Hebrew, and so few who know Hebrew know also Keltic, that few know the

<p>These verses, part of a very lovely poem, "To Thee all Angels cry aloud,"
in the 'Monthly Packet' for September 1873, are only signed 'Veritas.' The
volume for that year (the 16th) is well worth getting, for the sake of the
admirable
papers in it by Miss Sewell, on questions of the day; by Miss A.C. Owen,
on Christian Art; and the unsigned Cameos from English History.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Platt has worked out an idea so striking
for its attractiveness and utility that, perceiving
it, we at once go to work wondering that somebody
else had not executed it before him. He has
gone over the vast and superb areas of John Ruskin's
Writings, and cutting out one block here and
another there, as it has suited his purpose, has put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
all these parts together again into a literary mosaic,
constituting a clear and harmonious system of art
principles, wherein Ruskin all the while is the
teacher. He has reduced Ruskin to a code. On
the whole, we see not what this book lacks of
being a complete text-book of the Gospel of Art
according to St. John Ruskin."&mdash;<i>Christian Union</i>.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
